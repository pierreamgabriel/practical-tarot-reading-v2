    "name": "The Fool",
    "id": "fool",
    "img": "images/fool.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p>The Fool Tarot card is a card of potential, new beginnings and innocence. This Tarot card shows the highest potential for your life, reaching a state of renewal and new beginnings, where each day is an adventure and each moment is lived to the fullest. The Fool card represents the beginning of all creativity and a desire to accomplish new goals (or to, at least, start the process of working towards those goals). The Fool indicates that anything can happen and the opportunities are just waiting to be taken advantage of.</p><p>In a Tarot reading, the Fool represents the need to set forth on a new journey, one that is completely unknown and will take you to uncharted territories. The Fool is all about new experiences, personal growth, development and adventure. The Fool Tarot card asks you to take a ‘leap of faith’ and to trust in the Universe in that if you begin a new journey, you will find success. This Fool lives a carefree life, free from worry and anxiety. He does not seem to mind if he does not really know what lies ahead.</p><p>The Fool Tarot card may represent a choice to be made—one of vital importance. However, there are always many different options available and the choice must be made wisely. If you are facing a decision or moment of doubt, the Fool encourages you to believe in yourself and follow your heart no matter how crazy or foolish your impulses may seem. This is a time when you need to truly ‘believe’ and have faith in where the Universe is taking you.</p><p>The Fool is an excellent Tarot card to meditate on if you are experiencing a lot of fear in your life. The Fool enhances courage, risk-taking and the creative expression needed to open up new areas in your life.</p><p>The Fool is always whole, healthy and without fear. He is the spirit of who we are, the spirit expressed and experienced as wonder, awe, curiosity and anticipation. We never know what is in the future but like the Fool we must blindly go forward. You need to trust that you are a spirit born into flesh to enjoy life and grow in experience. Take a chance and see what happens.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Fool reversed suggests that you have conceived of a new project but aren’t ready to ‘birth’ it into the world just yet. You may worry that you are not fit or that you don’t have all the tools, skills and resources you need to make this project a success. Or perhaps you have a sense that the timing isn’t right. Something is holding you back, and you are preventing yourself from moving forward. You may choose to keep this new opportunity to yourself for now, or you might be ‘parking’ it until a better time.</p><p>You may fear the unknown, wondering, ‘What am I getting myself into?’ As a result, you have come to a standstill, worried about taking any action where you don’t know the outcome. This often boils down to the need to control everything. Balance this out with knowing that the Universe has your back and you can take this step forward, even if you are unsure of exactly what will happen next.</p><p>On the flipside, the reversed Fool can show that you are taking too many risks and acting recklessly. In your attempt to live ‘in the moment’ and be spontaneous and adventurous, you may do so in total disregard of the consequences of your actions and engaging in activities that put both yourself and others at risk. Look at the bigger picture and consider how you can keep the free spirit of the Fool without harming others.</p><p>In light of the playful and fun energy of the upright Fool, the reversal suggests you are exploring this spirit on a more personal and quiet level. For example, instead of letting down your hair and dancing up on stage, you are dancing in your bedroom like no-one is watching. Look at how you can bring more play into your daily life, even if you start out by doing it in private.</p>"

    "name": "The Magician",
    "id": "magician",
    "img": "images/magician.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Magician Tarot card typically appears in a Tarot reading at a time in your life when you have the creative power and energy to create a new life cycle for yourself. You have the ability to take the power of the Universe and manifest your desires. The Magician Tarot card suggests that a situation has been (or soon will be) presented to you that has all the inherent components to allow the manifestation of your desires. Those desires may be spiritual (fire), physical (earth), emotional (water), or mental (air), and are each aligned with the four elements of the Tarot. You have the ability to make it happen!</p><p>With the Magician Tarot card, you are inspired to apply skill and initiative to accomplish all your goals. You have a strong desire to begin something new, to ‘do, act, or go forth’. A ‘can-do’ attitude and strong sense of optimism will dominate a new beginning and thus the decisions that you make will have positive results.</p><p>The Magician card sees you creating success in everything that you do. This is a Tarot card about manifesting your goals by utilising the skills, tools and resources that are available to you. The Magician suggests that you will come up with creative ways to solve problems and you will be able to use your existing knowledge and networks to arrive at solutions.</p><p>The Magician Tarot card is a good omen when you have a specific wish, when you begin a project involving creativity, or when you need to make a transformation of any kind. This is a great Tarot card for meditation when you need to call all the elements for help and wisdom.</p><p>The Magician Tarot card indicates that you can benefit from your creative forces if you can claim your power and act with awareness and concentration. This card is a signal to act consciously and act now provided you understand exactly what you want and are committed to getting it. You need to know what you are doing and why you are doing it. Be clear about your underlying motives and intentions.</p><p>The Magician is also a Tarot card of deep concentration on a specific task or activity. You need to be focused on a single goal or purpose at this time and you need to channel all of your energy, tools and resources towards this one goal. Commitment to the task is essential and as such, you will need to eliminate any distractions that will take your focus away from what you want to achieve.</p><p>The Magician shows that you are doing a great job at pulling together all of the skills, resources and tools that are available to you in order to bring about an outcome that suits you. You are keeping a very pragmatic head about you and you are trying to remain as objective and ‘can-do’ as possible, even if you are worried on the inside. Keep this up as it will help you to create as much success as possible. Keep thinking about what other skills and resources you can use and keep focused on the task at hand.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>On one level, the reversed Magician shows you are exploring what you wish to manifest, but you are not taking action yet. You are uncertain if you have everything you need and may be unsure about how to make it happen. If you take care of what you intend to manifest, the Universe will work out the how. Stay attuned to your intuition and pay attention to opportunities as they arise. These are like little breadcrumbs that will take you closer to your goal.</p><p>If you are already acting on your goal, the reversed Magician can be a sign that you are struggling to see progress or success. Several factors may be at play. Perhaps you have an idea but don’t know what action to take to manifest it. Perhaps you are not clear on your desired outcome so your efforts are misdirected or unfocused. Maybe you have lost touch with your ‘why’, or it wasn’t compelling enough, and now you’re lacking motivation in completing the goal. Or perhaps your end goal is out of alignment with your Highest Good and the Universe is sending you a big “Stop! Go Back!” sign.</p><p>At its worst, the reversed Magician signifies greed, manipulation and trickery. You may be masterful at manifesting, but if you are out of touch with your Higher Self, you may only do it for your personal gain and at the expense of others. Sometimes you may fall into this trap unintentionally. If your goals are not coming to fruition or something feels ‘off’, tune into that and asking yourself if you are working for the highest good or solely for your own benefit.</p><p>In a career reading, the Magician reversed shows that you have many skills, talents, and capabilities, but your real potential is not being maximised. You may realise that you have so much more to give. Or perhaps you know you are great at something, but you have not allowed yourself the opportunity to nurture and explore this skill. What is impeding you from using these abilities? What needs to change for you to reach your fullest potential?</p>"

    "name": "The High Priestess",
    "id": "high-priestess",
    "img": "images/high-priestess.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The High Priestess represents wisdom, serenity, knowledge and understanding. She is often described as the guardian of the unconscious. She sits in front of the thin veil of awareness, which is all that separates us from our inner selves. The High Priestess knows the secret of how to access these realms. She represents spiritual enlightenment and inner illumination, divine knowledge and wisdom. She has a deep, intuitive understanding of the Universe and uses this knowledge to teach rather than to try to control others. She generally appears in a Tarot reading when you need to listen to and trust your inner voice.</p><p>The High Priestess Tarot card represents a link to the subconscious mind, which cannot be accessed through the everyday world but only through dreams and symbols. When this Tarot card appears in a Tarot reading, pay attention to your dreams and intuition. Look for areas in your life that may be out of balance or that require greater foresight and wisdom. Knowledge of how to fix it will not come through logic or intellect but through your intuition so put aside a time when you can meditate and listen to your own inner voice. Your intuitive sense right now is providing you with useful and helpful information and is assisting you to become more in touch with your subconscious mind.</p><p>For a male especially, the High Priestess Tarot card indicates that he must learn of his ‘anima’ or female side, or he will fail to grow. For a woman, the High Priestess suggests that she must learn to trust herself and to be truly feminine, rather than succumbing to the pressures of having to act more like her male counterparts.</p><p>The High Priestess in a Tarot reading can also point to the unknown and can indicate that your life is changing. Things that once seemed certain can no longer be taken for granted. Some puzzling mysteries become clearer but all is not yet revealed at this point. On the plus side, you will find that your intuitive powers are increasing and you may be inspired to be creative. The High Priestess Tarot card is therefore a particularly good card for poets and writers.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed High Priestess calls on you to be still and direct your attention inward to listen to your voice and wisdom. You may be swayed by other people’s opinions or swept up in their drama when what you really need to do is focus on what is right for you. It is time to get quiet and withdraw yourself from the external world to observe what your inner guidance is sharing with you now.</p><p>Ask yourself: Do I struggle to trust my intuition fully? Perhaps you doubt yourself or feel silly or guilty for listening to your intuition, and as a result, you deny your ability to tune in and receive this potent information. You may also keep your intuitive capabilities hidden from others, fearful of their judgements or opinions. If this resonates, know that your intuition is your superpower, here to guide you and help you. Have faith in the Universe and allow yourself to be in flow with its energies. Surrender and let go.</p><p>Think of the High Priestess as the calm centre inside of you that is untouched by your external world and trust that she is always there when you need her. Whenever you worry that things are just getting too crazy, find a quiet space and meditate so you can hear her voice. If you stop thinking or fretting about your issue and instead clear the way for your intuition to speak to you, the answer will follow.</p><p>Finally, the secretive nature of the High Priestess may suggest gossip and hidden agendas. Others may be keeping information from you or talking about you behind your back and sharing mistruths. Rather than making assumptions or diving into the depths of paranoia, have an open and honest conversation to surface and address these secrets.</p>"

    "name": "The Empress",
    "id": "empress",
    "img": "images/empress.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Empress shows a deep connection with our femininity. Femininity translates in many ways – beauty, sensuality, fertility, creative expression, nurturing – and is necessary in creating balance in both men and women. The Empress calls on you to connect with your feminine energy. Create beauty in your life. Get in touch with your sensuality through taste, touch, sound, smell and sight. Draw on these senses to experience pleasure and deep fulfilment. Treat yourself to a day spa, learn massage, enjoy a fine dining experience, or simply spend more time with your partner. Discover new ways to creatively express yourself, be it through painting, music, drama, or other art forms. This may be the perfect time to take up a new hobby that enables you to access this part of yourself.</p><p>The Empress may also indicate pregnancy or birth. Look to other cards in the reading to confirm if this is an actual pregnancy or birth (for example, the Ace or Page of Cups or the Four of Wands) or if it is metaphorical (for example, the Ace of Wands). On a metaphorical level, the Empress may represent the birth of a new idea, a product, or a new way of being. New ideas and projects will be implemented resulting in the success of all your projects and interests. Bring forth those ideas that have been growing and developing inside of you.</p><p>The Empress encourages you to spend time in nature. Use your holiday time not to stay in fancy hotels in busy cities but to explore nature by pitching a tent or hiking through its beautiful terrain. Allow yourself the time and the space to enter into a different frame of mind in which you can truly connect with Mother Earth and receive her into your heart and mind. Take a trip to your favourite natural setting, be it a forest, beach, mountain or lake and simply sit for a couple of minutes, hours or even days to breathe in the energy that surrounds you while marvelling in the beauty of the earth. The Empress highlights that you are grounded in the material plane (a stabilising influence), yet you can reach into higher planes of consciousness through your connection with nature. You have the potential to connect between the Earth and the Universe.</p><p>The Empress is a deeply nurturing and caring card. If you are a mother yourself, you may be exploring your ‘mother’ role even more deeply than you have before and truly appreciating the gift that has been bestowed upon you. You are blessed by maternal, protective forces or influences. For fathers, the Empress encourages you to nurture your children and open the lines of communication between you and your child. Encourage growth and development of your children, and be there to support and guide when needed.</p><p>More broadly, the Empress encourages you to connect with others by nurturing, caring and supporting those around you. Find ways to support dialogue and open communication, creating a space to openly express your feelings.</p><p>When we allow ourselves to truly experience the connections with Mother Earth, our femininity and those around us, we create abundance and radiance in our lives. Take a moment to reflect on the love that surrounds you and build on this energy to create even more abundant love in your life. Know that love is limitless. A wonderful affirmation associated with the Empress is, “I bring forth my creations with joy. I love and nurture them to fruition.”</p><p>Similarly, the Empress indicates that the Universal energy is about to intervene in your life. It may be just enough to give you a glimpse of a miracle or it may be even more. You may or may not know whom or what brings such good fortune but the care and nurturing that will result come as no accident. What appears to be coincidental good luck may actually be the result of a series of good choices you have made. It is your turn to have things work out in your favour, to be blessed and to feel nurtured. Know that you are worthy of receiving this loving embrace.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>Reversed, the Empress encourages you to make self-love and self-care a priority. Now is the time to bring your loving energy and focus to yourself, especially if you have been giving away your personal power by placing too much emphasis on another person’s emotional or material needs, thus neglecting your own. Book a girls’ weekend, go for a walk on your own or start a creative project that’s just for you. It is essential that you fill your cup and care for yourself so you can then take care of others without resentment.</p><p>You may also crave a stronger connection with nature and Mother Earth. Now is the perfect occasion to spend even just a few hours in a natural setting such as a beach, park or garden. Breathe in the radiant energy as you’re surrounded by nature’s beauty and take time to notice the little things: an ant racing along on the ground, new leaves budding on the trees, or the rich purples and greens of the flowers and plants.</p><p>The Empress reversed can suggest that you are feeling a creative block, especially in ‘birthing’ a new idea or expressing yourself creatively. You may worry whether it will be a success or if your work is appealing to others. For now, don’t bother about what others think. The important thing is that you are allowing your creative energy to flow, even if it means keeping your newest creations private to you only (and even if they look like a three-year-old created them!).</p><p>The reversed Empress may call your attention to issues around body image. Are you your biggest critic when it comes to how you look and the shape of your body? Learn to love your body again and give thanks for the lovely curves, lumps and bumps. Rediscover your beauty, inside and out.</p><p>In your relationships, you may take the ‘mothering’ role too far, becoming overprotective, co-dependent and controlling. If this resonates, it is time to shift your focus from the mother-child relationship to an adult-to-adult relationship by creating independence, trust and loving compassion.</p>"

    "name": "The Emperor",
    "id": "emperor",
    "img": "images/emperor.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Emperor is the father figure of the Tarot deck. He is the ‘provider’ and protects and defends his loved ones. He has established a solid family line and is often seen as the patriarch of a wide network of family members. He offers guidance, advice and wisdom to others and in doing so, demonstrates authority and grounding. His wisdom is obtained through worldly, life experience. He has ‘been there, done that’, and has the battle armour to prove it. He takes what he has learned, and passes it on to the next generation, so someday they can be as wise and powerful as he is. He brings security and comfort to those around him.</p><p>The Emperor is also representative of structure and stability. He is able to create order out of chaos by carefully categorising his thoughts and mapping out what needs to be done to solve the problem. He is a systematic and strategic thinker and is highly organised and coordinated in his approach. He sticks to a plan and ensures he sees it out until the end. Thus, this card indicates that you have a strong desire to see your ideas manifested on the physical plane in the form of material gain or accomplishment. An opportunity will arrive that could be the foundation of a very successful future.</p><p>The Emperor reflects rules and regulations. He establishes law and order by applying principles or guidelines to a specific situation. He likes to operate within a defined structure with set boundaries. He respects routine and follows a specific regimen or discipline.</p><p>Domination of the mind over the heart is sometimes unwanted or best avoided but with the Emperor, it is necessary and even welcomed. If you are facing difficult choices, you must maintain your concentration and focus. Enjoy the assertiveness and confidence that this self-control and focus brings. Push ahead and do what you know is best. Know that if you can master yourself then you should have little problem mastering the world and everything in it.</p><p>The Emperor is a powerful leader who demands authority and dominance. He is most comfortable in a leadership role where he can command and direct others. He likes to be in a position of strength, where he can exert control and bring a sense of organisation to his activities. He often represents a solid establishment that is built on strong foundations. As a leader, he rules with a firm but fair hand. He will listen to the advice of others but he will always have the final say. He is not afraid of war and/or conflict and he will not hesitate to use his force and power to protect those he cares about. The privileged few whom he favours always repay him with the loyalty and respect he deserves.</p><p>The Emperor heralds status, success and recognition. You will have an earnest desire to be recognised as a strong figure of unquestioned achievement and authority. You will want to be known as the dominant force, the leader and the ‘expert’. Focus your attention completely on your goal and be very careful not to reveal any weaknesses or personal doubt.</p><p>If you come across the Emperor in your own life, then you will need to be ready to impress! The Emperor administers and governs the area you wish to enter. You cannot achieve your dreams and goals without this person’s blessing. With the Emperor’s support, you will have a much better chance of actualising your dream and you can begin to benefit from the established structure he has formed.</p><p>Sometimes, the Emperor can represent the power of the government or a decision-making body. Within yourself, there is also a force that governs your actions. These forces are will power and self-control. You may have discussions concerning contractual agreements, profit sharing, subsidies or management.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed Emperor calls on you to assess your relationship with power, control, authority, responsibility and discipline. Are you expressing too much or too little of these elements in your life right now? Are they working for you or against you?</p><p>In the reversed position, the Emperor can be domineering and rigid in his thinking. The card can suggest an over-use and abuse of authoritative power surrounding you. It could originate from you or from another person, often a boss, partner or father figure. And it may be because of deep insecurities or father issues from childhood.</p><p>Consider the role that power plays in your life. Are you asserting your power and dominance in a way that leaves others feeling powerless? Or are you giving away your personal power to please someone else, often a father-figure or a person in authority? Seek to find a solution where you lead from a place of personal power and enable others to do the same. Power can be equally and constructively distributed – you don’t need to take it from others, nor do you need to give yours away.</p><p>The reversed Emperor may be a sign that others look to you as their leader or as an expert in the field but you are shying away from the role. You may fear being seen as the leader, instead preferring to hide in the shadows or stay out of the spotlight. There may be other ways you can make an impact and influence the world, such as authoring a book or training others to reach a bigger audience.</p><p>Sometimes, the reversed Emperor asks you to stand up to authority. You may feel fed up with an overbearing boss or a hierarchical organisation and feel compelled to enter a more flexible and adaptive environment. Maybe you aspire to be your own boss and work independently by starting up your own business. Or, you may seek a career where you can have greater flexibility and creativity in how you complete your work. You are sick of having to always work within the confines of a particular structure or way of doing things, and you want to break free from it.</p><p>When the reversed Emperor pops up in a Tarot reading, pay attention to your commitment to your goals and your self-discipline to get the job done. If you are struggling to see any real outcomes, check that you have a plan in place, a routine to support it, and the dedication to see it through. You may need to get a little tough on yourself and do the uncomfortable work you’d prefer to avoid. But if you can harness the positive, upright energy of the Emperor, your efforts will lead to success.</p><p>In a relationship reading, the reversed Emperor suggests that you may be in an unequal partnership and it‘s making you unhappy in the long term. Your significant other has become overbearing, possessive, dominating and authoritative. While you may have been looking for a partner to take care of you and offer a stable foundation for the future, those qualities have gone too far, and it seems as though much of your independence and freedom have been taken away. This dynamic is putting a strain on the relationship and preventing a flow of energies between you.</p>"

    "name": "The Hierophant",
    "id": "hierophant",
    "img": "images/hierophant.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Hierophant is very conventional and this Tarot card suggests that you have a desire to follow due process and to stay within the conventional bounds of what is typically an orthodox approach. Instead of being innovative, you will need to adapt to the existing set of beliefs and systems that are already in place. You will need to do what is expected of you. The appearance of the Hierophant in a Tarot reading indicates that this is certainly not a time to challenge the status quo!</p><p>The Hierophant Tarot card suggests that you may be wise to follow established social structures and traditions. You may be involved in some sort of ritual, ceremony, or the trappings of religion. There is also a need to honour some tradition in your life, or maybe start some traditions of your own if you have none. Consider also exploring your spiritual or religious heritage.</p><p>In Tarot readings, the Hierophant card often stands for institutions and their values. The Hierophant is a symbol of the need to conform to rules or fixed situations. His appearance can show that you are dealing with a force that is not innovative, free-spirited or individual but is instead fixated on the ‘way we have always done things around here’. Groups can be enriching or stifling depending on circumstances. Sometimes we need to follow a program or embrace tradition, while at other times we need to trust ourselves.</p><p>The Hierophant Tarot card indicates that you may feel compelled to join some sort of group or institution. It may be as significant as joining a new church or religious group, or as simple as joining a gym. This Tarot card is about identifying with a group and a way of thinking that will have benefit for you and will prompt further learning.</p><p>In his focus on sharing knowledge through an institution, the Hierophant represents education and the pursuit of knowledge. This Tarot card can indicate a period of increased studying and learning, through formal mechanisms. You seek to understand a field of study that has been widely explored and documented, and so you may go to a well-known or established teacher to find out more.</p><p>The Hierophant may also appear in your life as a psychotherapist, a wise counsellor, a priest, or a spiritual mentor to whom you will turn for wisdom and knowledge. He may be an authority or a kind and generous mentor who nurtures a spiritual awareness. You will learn new skills from this helpful teacher as he has the wisdom to provide good counsel and advice.</p><p>The Hierophant Tarot card represents an institutionalised means for accessing the sacred and is the carrier and transmitter of ancient wisdom and religious teaching. He represents a link between us and the Divine and, for this reason, he is often referred to as the Pope. The role of the Pope is traditionally that of the mediator between God and mankind. As such, the Hierophant represents the spiritual teacher who helps us come into contact with the Divine. Unlike the Magician, who simply points the way, the Hierophant is a trusted guide, one who will take us by the hand and lead us to our spiritual goal. He represents a gateway to a higher consciousness reached in a ritualised manner. He teaches that which can be learned by word and example.</p><p>All things that are righteous and sacred come with the Hierophant Tarot card – marriage, alliance, captivity, servitude, mercy and goodness, inner conscience and outer conscience.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>In its most positive form, the reversed Hierophant reminds you that you are your own teacher. All the wisdom you seek comes from within – not from some external source or power. You are being guided to follow your own path and adopt your own spiritual belief systems rather than blindly following others’. It may feel unsettling at first as you make your own way, but over time, you will learn to trust yourself and tap into your inner knowledge. Others may question your motivations to go against tradition, but you know deep within that now is the time.</p><p>With the reversed Hierophant, you no longer need external approval to succeed. You are ready to go it alone and do it your way, even if that means going against convention. Give yourself permission to trust your inner guidance system as you create your own path forward.</p><p>The Hierophant reversed is also about challenging the status quo. You see alternative ways of viewing the world and are ready to test the very ideas and concepts you were taught were the ‘truth’. You no longer accept the rigid structures, tradition and dogma surrounding you; instead, you seek out opportunities to rebel and reclaim your personal power. If you feel restricted or constrained and have lost your sense of freedom and flexibility, now is the time to make your own rules.</p><p>The reversed Hierophant encourages you to examine ‘the way we do things around here’ and ask yourself whether it aligns with your values. You may have been running on autopilot so far and following the crowd, but now you see that changes need to be made. Taken further, the Hierophant reversed is like a rebellious teenager who begins to question society and take part in anti-institutional activities. There may be a run-in with authorities or conflict with a parent or authoritative figure.</p>"
}, {
    "name": "The Lovers",
    "id": "lovers",
    "img": "images/lovers.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Lovers represent perfection, harmony and mutual attractiveness. Their trust in one another gives them strength and confidence to overcome the obstacles in life. The bond that the two lovers has created is incredibly strong and is often reflective of a marriage, soul mate connection or very intimate and close relationship.</p><p>The Lovers can also indicate a very strong sexual connection that goes beyond instant gratification and lust to suggest a very deep desire and passion that exists between two beings. The physical attraction is strong and so too is the desire to be intimate with one another.</p><p>On a more personal level, the Lovers card represents the establishment of a personal belief system and becoming clearer about your own values. This is a time when you are figuring out what you stand for and what your personal philosophy on life is. Having gone through the indoctrination of the Hierophant, you are now ready to establish your own belief system and make up your own mind about what is and what is not important in life. This is also a time when you need to stay true to yourself and be as authentic and genuine as possible.</p><p>The Lovers also represents choices on a grand scale. A dilemma will be presented demanding an action or decision, and you will want to decipher the best way to proceed or make the right choice. Something is going to change your plans or the course of your experience, something that may look negative on the surface but will later prove to be a blessing in disguise.</p><p>When the Lovers card appears in a reading, it is important to think about what decisions and choices you are facing. The fact that the Lovers is a Major Arcana card indicates that these decisions or choices are incredibly important and significant so it is essential that you choose the right path. There may be an easy option available but you will need to ask yourself whether this is the right path for you in the long run. Oftentimes, it is the more difficult path that will bring you the greatest benefit, particularly on a deeper level.</p><p>If you find yourself at a moral crossroads where you must choose between taking the moral high ground or the low ground, then you need to consider all consequences before acting. The Lovers card highlights that your own value system is being challenged, and you must make a definite choice based on that system. The choices are never really easy or obvious, either. Unlike the Fool’s choice which has no wrong answer, the choice of the Lovers is very much right or wrong because one of those options will almost certainly take you down a negative path. Thus, it is wise to seek higher guidance before making your final decision. You must be completely honest with yourself in the situation. Do not take things strictly on face value but deeply examine your motives, your feelings, your options and your personal values.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Lovers card is pure love and harmony. Reversed, it can signal a time when you’re out of sync with those around you, particularly your loved ones. You may find your relationships are strained and communication is challenging. Does it seem as if you are just not on the same page and no longer share the same values? If so, come back to the reason you have this person in your life. If you love him or her unconditionally, know this moment shall pass and the best you can do is bring love and compassion to the situation. In other cases, you may realise that you have simply grown apart and it’s time to move on. If your relationship continues to be peppered by arguments and a lack of respect for one another, then it could be time to let go. Honour yourself and do what is best for you both.</p><p>The Lovers reversed can also reflect that the feelings within a relationship are not mutual. One person may be more emotionally involved than the other, and this gap could lead to disappointment and insecurity later down the track. You may be reluctant to open your heart to the relationship for fear of getting hurt.</p><p>The reversed Lovers also speaks to self-love and respect. To what extent do you honour and accept who you are and the value you offer in this world? Be mindful, too, if you look at other people and wish you were more like them. Understand that if you can recognise these traits in others, it is because you have them within you. As Dr John Demartini says: ‘When we admire qualities in others, it’s the Universe’s way to get you to wake up and recognise your own strengths – in other words, you need to realise that whatever you perceive in other people you also have within yourself.’</p><p>If the Lovers reversed shows up in a reading, you might face a tough choice with significant consequences. Instead of making a decision based on your values, you feel tempted to cut corners and avoid responsibility for your actions. You may think you can get away with it, but the reversed Lovers implores you to think again and choose the path most in alignment with your Highest Good – no matter how hard it might be.</p><p>The Lovers reversed can also suggest inner conflicts and being at war with yourself rather than with external forces. It indicates disharmony and a struggle to balance your inner union. Are you punishing yourself for something you have done or considered yourself responsible for? To help you out of this place, you will need to focus on articulating your personal belief systems and values. They will guide you in making better decisions next time. You may want to return to the energy of the Hierophant and seek the counsel and advice of an institution or spiritual mentor.</p>"

    "name": "The Chariot",
    "id": "chariot",
    "img": "images/chariot.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Chariot represents conquest, victory and overcoming opposition through your confidence and control. Any success will be a result of applying these factors to the situation. You will need to use the strength of your willpower to overcome any obstacles or challenges in your way. You may even find that by leveraging any opposing forces surrounding you at this time you can use them to your advantage. You must be determined, self-disciplined, and hard working. If you are, you will triumph over any difficulties or anyone who is trying to limit you. This struggle will ultimately make you stronger.</p><p>You will be successful at pursuing your goals, so long as you maintain focus, determination and confidence in your abilities. You need to focus completely on the task at hand, get in the race and win it. You have to dominate and beat the competition. You must cultivate the ability to withstand the rigours of what is required. In fact, striving towards your goal can be as satisfying as attaining it. This is a time to be strong and in control. You must also draw upon your willpower and self-discipline.</p><p>You may be wondering if you should pursue a plan or continue a project but you will be driven to do so, and your perplexing dilemma will be resolved for the time being.</p><p>The Chariot requires you to assert yourself and be bold. You may need to look after yourself at this time and be confident in expressing your needs and wants, otherwise you will not get your way. You need to have faith in yourself and know fundamentally who you are and what you stand for (thus building off the personal belief systems and values established through the Lovers card).</p><p>Sometimes, the Chariot asks you to come to terms with your own aggressive impulses. Aggression is part of human nature, part of your innate survival mechanism. Aggression cannot be simply suppressed; to do so will only turn it inward on yourself, leaving it to manifest itself in the form of physical illness. Aggression can be very destructive but it is also a powerful energy that can be channelled creatively. This is a time when you need to be the master of your emotions and curb any impulses or anger. You need to show who is the boss and achieve control of the situation but this will also require you to be in control of yourself.</p><p>The Chariot can also represent a lot of driving and even a road trip. You may even be considering buying an RV and heading off across the country!</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>Upright, the Chariot is a green light to move ahead with a key project and push past any obstacles that might impede your desired outcome. Reversed, however, the Chariot tells you to ‘back up the truck’ or, as we Aussies say, “Chuck a U-y” (AKA “do a U-turn”). You might bang your head against a brick wall, trying to push a project forward when really, you ought to back off or change direction. Or you might have lost your motivation and no longer feel as committed to the outcome as you did when you started. So, if something is not moving forward as you planned, re-evaluate the situation and check in to see if it’s a sign that you need to change course. Then ask yourself: Is there a deeper reason things have become more challenging? What lesson can I learn here?</p><p>At times, the reversed Chariot is a warning that you are letting obstacles and challenges get in the way, preventing you from achieving what you set out to do. It’s all getting too hard, and you don’t have the will to go on. If that resonates, stop for a moment and think about the things that matter most to you and why you want to achieve this goal. Will you allow other people’s opinions to sway you or give up as soon as the going gets tough? Or will you follow through on your commitment?</p><p>Before taking action, the reversed Chariot may be a hint that you are focusing your energy and attention on your internal processes, such as self-discipline, inner determination and personal commitment. You may home in on the intentions that align with your Higher Self. Or, you can use visualisation and meditation to make sure your energy aligns with your goals. These internally focused actions are essential so that when the time comes to act, you will be ready.</p><p>If you are someone who likes to have command over your destiny and know where you are heading, take this opportunity to tighten the reins and become more disciplined in what you are doing. While feeling a loss of power can be quite demoralising, the key is to look at what you can control and what you cannot. Do not allow yourself to worry about what is out of your grasp as you cannot change it now. Instead, focus your energies on what IS in your control. Examine what you can do to improve the situation.</p><p>Similarly, the Chariot reversed suggests that you may be trying to manage every minute detail in your life – but in doing so, you feel even more out of control. Loosen your grip and let things run their course. Be open to offers of help and then be grateful for what you receive, even if it’s not perfectly aligned with your expectations. You do not always have to be in the driver’s seat!</p>"

    "name": "Strength",
    "id": "strength",
    "img": "images/strength.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Strength Tarot card represents strength, determination, and power in a manner similar to the Chariot. However, the differences between the two Tarot cards are obvious. Where the Chariot represents outer strength and will, the Strength card represents inner strength and the power of the human spirit to overcome any obstacle. The meaning of the Strength Tarot card is about knowing that you can endure life’s obstacles by drawing upon your inner strength and confidence. You have great stamina and persistence, tempered by an underlying patience and inner calm. You are focused on what you need to do, and you go about it in a way that demonstrates great composure and maturity.</p><p>The Strength Tarot card also reflects a compassionate approach. You are like the woman in this card who offers love and patience to the ferocious lion in order to be able to tame him. You give others space and you are tolerant of their needs. You are accepting and can easily forgive any imperfections. In doing this, you create a safe and trusting environment where you can then gently influence others. This demonstrates a level of ‘soft’ control, persuading and coaxing others to your way of thinking.</p><p>The Strength archetype teaches you that you have the strength to tame the beasts within yourself. Meditating on this card can assist your process of honouring and experiencing the inherent strength that is within your nature.</p><p>The lion in the Strength card symbolises your animalistic nature. And the young woman symbolises your opportunity to 'tame' the wild beast within. So, when you learn to fully master your raw, instinctual behaviours, thoughts and emotions, the positive qualities of the Strength Tarot card will emerge from within you. The main lesson from this card is that emotions must be transcended if spiritual wisdom and intuition are to be awakened. Your inner voice is often drowned out by the dominant noise of ego and fear. Let go of these negative emotions and you will begin to create the silence you need to hear your inner self. Conquer your fears, control your impulses, and never lose patience with yourself or what you are doing. Eventually you will see the wisdom of letting go of your lower, 'animalistic' self.</p><p>The Strength Tarot card shows a balance of the aspects of you that are human, animal and divine. It may seem impossible but love, kindness and a brave heart can bring them into balance. In a Tarot reading, the appearance of the Strength Tarot card indicates a time when you need to be very conscious of your instinctual urges and reactions, and bring them into balance with the greater good and meaning in life. This is not a time to act out in rage or in hatred but instead to look at the situation from a place of love and compassion.</p><p>The Strength Tarot card represents a higher level of consciousness that allows you to take responsibility for yourself, so that you can master yourself and your world. The Strength card reminds us that inside each of us is a passionate and instinctual side that, depending on the person, will either burst out frequently or infrequently. If you are one of those people who acts impulsively or irrationally, and who blurts out angry comments or negative things to others, the Strength Tarot card calls on you to try to tame yourself. The woman in this card is calmly subduing the lion by offering peace, love, and warmth. You may need to do the same to prevent yourself from leaping out at others and saying some things you might later regret.</p><p>In a Tarot reading, Strength offers you the hope of connecting with both your inner and outer strength. It asks you to find the confidence within yourself to present yourself to the world as strong, assertive, and persevering. If you have been self-doubting, the Strength Tarot card gives you the confidence to fight those doubts. Additionally, if you are feeling worn out or stressed, Strength says to you, “Things are going to get better! You are going to find the strength within yourself and within others to keep going!”</p><p>When you see the Strength card in a Tarot reading, it is an important sign that you are strong and you have the endurance necessary to see whatever task that is bothering you through to its eventual end. If you are pushing too hard and forcing change, Strength shows the need to withdraw for the moment, and to be patient. Alignment with your Higher Self and full manifestation of your goals will come only when the time is right – it cannot be rushed.</p><p>With the Strength Tarot card, it is clear that strength and courage will be applied to all your endeavours. Results may be slow in coming but you will hold your own, get a lot accomplished and summon up enough energy to do what it takes to get the job done. One way or another, you will be recognised or rewarded for your efforts.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>When the reversed Strength card appears in a Tarot reading, tune in to your current levels of inner strength, confidence and self-belief. Are you overflowing with self-confidence, or are you depleted? And how can you bring these aspects back into balance?</p><p>If you have recently experienced a setback, you may be vulnerable and lacking in self-confidence. Know that your core strength will always be with you and now is as good a time as any to reconnect with this power. In fact, you may hold more strength and resilience than you give yourself credit for – so, be kind to yourself. You can also reinvigorate your self-assurance and self-esteem by collecting evidence from your past that proves you have what it takes to succeed and overcome these temporary challenges.</p><p>Check in on your energy levels right now. You may be sluggish, particularly if you have been dedicating yourself to serving others or have been pushing hard to achieve a goal. The reversed Strength card is your invitation to take stock and restore your energy levels by resting and withdrawing for a temporary period. It’s vital that you take care of yourself so you can take care of others.</p><p>In its shadow form, the reversed Strength card can signal that you are prone to explosive behaviour, lashing out at others and becoming aggressive. You may act without thinking and end up doing something you regret later. The key is not to repress the raw emotion, but to learn how to channel it so it won’t harm others or yourself. Seek a professional to help you better deal with these emotions.</p>"

    "name": "The Hermit",
    "id": "hermit",
    "img": "images/hermit.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Hermit Tarot card suggests that you are in a phase of introspection where you are drawing your attention and focus inward and looking for answers within. You have a strong need to understand, not just at the surface level but to really know why life is the way it is. The Hermit reflects that your consciousness has moved inward and you now realise that the truth and understanding you seek is within yourself and not in the distractions of the outside world. This is a perfect time to take a step back from your day-to-day life and deeply contemplate your motivations, personal principles and values.</p><p>The Hermit reflects that you are engaging in a period of soul searching. You want to seek the truth at all costs. You desire a new direction in life and, as a result, have recently begun a journey of self-discovery and contemplation. There comes a point in life when we begin to question the status quo, knowing that there is a deeper meaning to life, and thus, we begin to search for it. This search is mainly a solitary quest because the answers do not lie in the external world but within us. Thus, the Hermit Tarot card indicates a time when you seek solitude and isolation from others. You need to be alone and you want to withdraw from the world around you. This is so that you can retreat further into your own private world and experience a deep sense of seclusion.</p><p>Through meditation, contemplation and self-examination, you may begin to re-evaluate your personal goals and change your overall direction. You will look at your life with a deeper, more spiritual understanding and will begin to change some of your priorities as a result. There is a certain level of spiritual attainment that is associated with the Hermit. The appearance of the Hermit in a Tarot card reading suggests that you need to develop the true power of a spiritual master through deep introspection. Be content with being alone or associate only with those on your level. Do not waste time and energy on those not ready or not worthy.</p><p>The Hermit represents the desire to turn away from a consumerist or materialistic society to focus on the inner world. Have you ever seen the movie or read the book, “Into the Wild”? After graduating from university, top student and athlete Christopher McCandless abandons his possessions, gives his entire $24,000 savings account to charity and hitchhikes to Alaska to live in the wilderness on his own. Whilst his story has a sad and tragic ending, his journey into the wild reminds me a lot of the Hermit, who seeks answers within and knows that they will come only with quiet and solitude.</p><p>The Hermit has learned to help others with love and compassionate detachment. This Tarot card indicates that you have gone beyond the point of being critical and you can now understand and appreciate that the varied paths people choose for themselves all lead to the same higher purpose. You have reached a high enough level of spiritual attainment yourself that you no longer need to convince others of what they should do. You can honour silence and allow your inner light to shine out towards others as a means of communication.</p><p>Meditating on the Hermit Tarot card teaches you to honour the wisdom within yourself. You must find your own light, shine it on your soul and create your own special path. Through meditation and visualisation, the Hermit allows you to get in touch with the wise person inherent within you.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed Hermit can go one of two ways: you are not taking enough time for personal reflection, or you are taking too much. If you struggle to connect with your spiritual self, the Hermit reversed encourages you to create more space to meditate and reflect. It is time to go deeper into your inner being and rediscover your greater purpose on this earth. You may have been so busy dealing with the day-to-day issues that you have forgotten to listen to your inner voice. The Hermit asks you to search deep within your soul to help you find your way again and focus on rebuilding yourself on a spiritual level.</p><p>If you have already been spending a lot of time reflecting on your inner self, then the reversed Hermit may suggest that you may be taking this isolation thing too far. Are you becoming a literal hermit and cutting yourself off from others? Do not underestimate the value of staying connected with others, even while you are going through your spiritual journey. Be mindful, too, of other people’s needs. You do not want to become so absorbed in yourself and your personal dilemmas that you shut out your family and friends.</p><p>In a relationship reading, the reversed Hermit can indicate unwelcome isolation. For example, one person may want to be alone or withdraw from the relationship, while the other wants to deepen the connection. You will need to respect each other’s request for space but also be there to support as appropriate. Alternatively, the idea of being on your own is so daunting and unappealing at this time that you do everything in your power to stay together. Despite the relationship‘s challenges, neither one of you wants to be apart from each other. It is almost too soon to be apart and you still both want to work things out together. If you have separated, then the Hermit reversed may show that you are ready to explore a reconnection.</p>"

    "name": "Wheel of Fortune",
    "id": "wheeloffortune",
    "img": "images/wheeloffortune.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Wheel of Fortune refers to the fact that things tend to go in cycles. There are good times and there are bad times. Even if your external environment is difficult and challenging, there will come a time when this will ease off and you will be able to focus more on creating fun and frivolity. The lesson of the Wheel of Fortune is that you must accept that there are always ups and downs in life. If you were to have only good times, you would become less appreciative of what you have. Sometimes the bad times provide the contrast and perspective you need to be able to recognise how blessed you are when the good times come. So, when times are good, enjoy the benefits but do not become complacent because things can change. When times are bad, do not be discouraged because even when things seem their worst it simply suggests that things can only get better!</p><P>The Wheel of Fortune suggests that you should not simply stand still and accept what life hands you. You can take an active hand to try and remain on the upside of the Wheel. When things are down, instead of waiting and hoping for things to get better, you can work actively towards improving your situation, thereby speeding up the recovery process. Finally, the Wheel asks you to not become discouraged when faced with adversity. Adversity is a natural part of life and should be expected from time to time. The fact that bad times happen should not worry you. Accept them as natural and not necessarily indicative of problems. Instead, look for ways in which you can face and conquer the adversity. If it cannot be addressed, then that might be taken as a suggestion of a problem.</p><p>The Wheel of Fortune suggests that there are external factors that are influencing your situation that may be unknown to you or outside of your control. It is as though the Universe is just dishing up whatever it pleases at this time, and it can feel quite unpredictable and unnerving as a result (especially if you like being in control most of the time!). This is one of the challenging aspects of the Wheel of Fortune since no matter which way the Wheel of Fortune turns, it is impossible to try and change it. So, you might as well try to accept what is happening and adapt accordingly. If a crisis seems inevitable, recall that in every crisis lies opportunity. When you have been pushed in a new direction, know that every path leads somewhere, even if you do not know where it is. Such events are simply out of your control, and if you can accept that then the ride gets a lot easier. If you struggle against the Wheel it will crush you. So just go with the flow!</p><p>The Wheel of Fortune is about keeping optimistic and having faith in the Universe that it will take care of the situation in the best way possible. You need to remain optimistic yourself, thinking positively and keeping as upbeat as possible. Through meditation and visualisation, the Wheel of Fortune can assist and reinforce your intention to bring increased abundance, good fortune and prosperity into your life. This archetype allows your life to turn in more positive directions if you are willing to grow and expand. This is also a ‘lucky’ time in life when you are sensing the action of fate and destiny working in your favour. You may even be witnessing miracles or a very fortunate series of events.</p><p>The Wheel represents karma and reminds you that ‘what goes around comes around’. In the upright position, you are likely to be at the positive end but again, do not become complacent. You still need to act in ways that are fundamentally ‘good’ to ensure that luck or positivity stays on your side.</p><p>The Wheel of Fortune speaks of a pivotal point in your life, where new options become possible. The appearance of the Wheel of Fortune shows that change is not only likely to happen, it is certain to happen, and soon. Generally the change shown in the Wheel of Fortune is a dramatic change from the established order. These changes are distinctly personal and may require making a first step on a new and unfamiliar path. You may also need to alter your present course, move things in a different direction or turn things around to ensure that you are creating the right outcomes in your life.</p><p>A great affirmation for the Wheel of Fortune is, “Through all the changes that the Universe brings, I feel the centre of stability which is within me.”</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>When the Wheel of Fortune is reversed, your luck and fortune may take a turn for the worst. You may experience unexpected change or negative forces could be at play, leaving you helpless. You have a choice: you can do nothing and hope things will get better, or you can act to improve your situation. See this moment as your opportunity to take control of your destiny and get your life back on track.</p><p>Changing your destiny starts with accepting responsibility for where you are now. Consider what role your earlier actions have played in your present circumstances. Even when you think everything is beyond your control, there is often something you could have done differently that might have changed where you are now. What can you learn from this situation and how can you apply it to your future life, so you don’t end up making the same mistakes?</p><p>The reversed Wheel of Fortune can also reflect resistance to change, particularly if you feel it forced upon you. This card suggests that change has become a source of significant stress, and you may be trying to consciously or subconsciously stop events from running their course. Accept that change is inevitable and you will have a much-improved experience when you can go with the flow.</p><p>On the positive side, the reversed Wheel of Fortune might mean that you are finally breaking a negative cycle that has been present in your life. Perhaps you have realised how your actions have created a repetitive situation and are now ready to break free from the cycle. For some, this may flow naturally following a period of introspection and self-discovery. For others, things may need to hit rock bottom before you are ready to see what is no longer serving you (especially if the Devil or Tower is in your reading).</p>"

    "name": "Justice",
    "id": "justice",
    "img": "images/justice.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>Put simply, the Justice card represents justice, fairness, truth and the law. As an outcome, the Justice card indicates that the fairest decision will be made. You are being called to account for your actions and be judged accordingly. Notice that Justice’s scales are balanced, thus its appearance indicates that events have worked out as they were meant to work out and that what is happening to you comes from the decisions you have made and the actions you have taken in the past. You have what you deserve.</p><p>Justice represents a conscious awareness that your decisions and actions have long-term consequences and your present and future circumstances are most likely a result of these decisions and actions. At the same time, Justice shows that your actions in the future can be changed by a lesson learned in the present situation. You cannot become honest without extending that honesty to yourself and others.</p><p>Justice reflects the search for truth. You need to know and speak the truth and perceive it in the words and deeds of others. Be fair and just with all and you will soon be able to detect dishonesty in yourself and others. Learn the rules that govern what you are involved with. This is a time to remain objective and to base your judgement on fact and not on heresay.</p><p>There is a need to be fair and just when you see the Justice card in a reading. When everyone is ‘playing fair’ and adhering to the rules, a positive outcome will be achieved. However, you need everyone to be on the same page for this to occur. It is no good if there is someone who is going against the grain or trying to stir things up!</p><p>The Justice card also indicates a time when decision-making is required. Something in your life needs attention, mediation or a solution. Look to the two cards lying on either side of the Justice card to understand what it is that you are weighing up in your decision-making. As you contemplate your decision, are you the person to pass judgment, or is your role to accept the decision that is made? How can you remain as objective as possible, whilst searching for the truth of the matter? It is an important time for your ‘inner umpire’ (i.e. your conscience) to make the ‘right’ decision. Balanced judgement exists.</p><p>Justice often refers to legal matters of all kinds. The courts are where judgments are made and decisions rendered. The legal system is the official arena in which the principles of Justice (fairness, impartiality and the quest for Truth) are explored. If you see the Justice card in a reading where there are legal matters at hand, expect the outcome to be just and fair. You are also likely to be dealing with legal contracts, such as a marriage license, divorce decree, business contract, financial arrangement or litigation. Where you are the person demanding justice, know that justice will be served and lawsuits won. Of course, if you have acted in a deceptive way or have not spoken the truth, be aware that justice will still prevail and you will need to take responsibility for your actions.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed Justice card can suggest that internally, you know you’ve done something that isn’t morally right. Others may not see it yet, so you have a choice: you can hide it and hope no-one finds out, or you can own up to your mistakes and take focused action to resolve the situation. Whichever you choose, you will need to live with the consequences on your conscience, so go with what feels right for you.</p><p>Similarly, Justice reversed suggests that you are not willing to take full accountability for your actions and may try to ‘dodge the bullet’ and blame others for your mistakes. You are being dishonest with yourself and others – and your unwillingness to look beyond your own fears and ego blinds you to the broader lesson. Assess your situation once more, this time intending to discover where you can accept responsibility. Once you acknowledge where you made a mistake, do whatever you can to make it right again. In doing so, you will free yourself from any guilt or shame and empower yourself to make better decisions.</p><p>The reversed Justice card can indicate your inner critic is in full effect. You may be evaluating your every move and coming down hard on yourself when you misstep. If this resonates, start from a place of forgiveness and self-acceptance. Show yourself a bit of kindness and compassion, knowing we all make mistakes. Thank your inner critic for bringing this private judgement to your conscious awareness, and trust you can now clear it away.</p><p>If you are making an important decision that will impact others, be aware if you are holding on to any prejudice or bias that could sway your decision unfairly. You may need to source more information to make a balanced decision or shine the light on your own personal judgements.</p><p>If you are engaged in a legal matter, you may fear an unfair outcome, or dispute the final judgement, calling into question the legal process. There may be legal complications or something that impedes justice being served.</p>"

    "name": "The Hanged Man",
    "id": "hangedman",
    "img": "images/hangedman.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Hanged Man reflects a need to suspend action, and as a result, a period of indecision may be indicated. Decisions or actions that need to be implemented will be postponed, even if, at the time, there is a sense of urgency to act. In fact, you may be much better off if you can stall on any decision-making and action-taking at this time in order to provide yourself with more time to reflect on the situation at hand and to consider the greater good. If you can buy yourself some more time or hold off on any further activities for a short period, then you may actually create a different, and better, outcome. This is a card that is all about suspension and waiting, and suggests that this may be just what you need to do in order to allow new possibilities to arise. Sometimes not acting will help to shed more light on what other options are available to you and will allow more attractive opportunities to emerge.</p><p>The Hanged Man can sometimes reflect that you are feeling stuck or restricted in your life. You need to get in touch with why you are feeling this way, and work to release yourself from these restrictions. In this way, the Hanged Man is also about letting go. You need an emotional release from whatever it is that is leaving you feeling stuck. Accept and surrender to your present circumstances. You may need to become more vulnerable and open to different experiences but this will help you end the struggle and give up your need for control. It is when you can really let go of all the worries and concerns that you have, that you find these concerns suddenly disappear and a new reality is possible.</p><p>The reversed position of the man in the Hanged Man indicates the need to look at yourself from an entirely different perspective, while the hanging indicates that your life is simply suspended for a time in order for you to recognise what needs to be changed in your personality. The tree is also abundant with leaves and vines, which suggests the possibility that the situation will bear fruit. Thus, the Hanged Man represents a reversal of your usual way of life and seeing the world from a completely different angle. Try hanging upside-down yourself and look around you. Does it not all look so different?! Your perspective has changed completely, yet the physical surroundings are exactly the same as when you were looking at it from an upright position. The Hanged Man asks you to turn your world around and view your situation differently. When you do this, you will find something new that will prove to be of greater value to you on a much deeper level. It may be that you have to sacrifice your previous beliefs or even way of life but it is a time of renewal and your life will go forward.</p><p>The Hanged Man is a willing victim, someone who has chosen the path of sacrifice to accomplish a higher goal. The Hanged Man represents the willingness to forsake the temptations of instant gratification for a higher cause, and because of this willing sacrifice he accomplishes the goals he has in his heart. He is like the ultimate martyr, putting his self-interest aside and giving up his personal needs for the greater good. Consider areas in your own life where you need to act in a more selfless manner, either for the benefit of others or for the fulfilment of your own deeper needs. On the flipside, you may need to assess your life for areas in which you are giving up too much to others at the expense of your own mental and spiritual well-being. Sometimes martyrdom can go too far!</p><p>Similarly, the Hanged Man tells you that you should be willing to lose something lesser in order to fulfil a greater goal. This goal is likely to be spiritual and personal. An investment of time, energy, and/or money may have to be made in order to reach this higher level of attainment. You are devoted to the cause and are open and ready to take on the task in front of you but first you need time to pause and consider.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The upright Hanged Man encourages you to pause for a moment and see things from a different perspective. Reversed, this card can show that you know you need to hit the pause button, but you are resisting it. Instead, you fill your days with tasks and projects, keeping busy and distracting yourself from the actual issue that needs your attention. Your spirit and body are asking you to slow down, but your mind keeps racing. Stop and rest before it’s too late. The Universe will only dial up the volume if you ignore it, and as a result, you may end up crashing. So, as soon as you hear the call, clear your schedule and make the space so you can tune in and listen.</p><p>You may already be in a position where everything has been put on hold, much to your frustration. The reversal of the Hanged Man can indicate a time when you’re getting blocked, stuck or restricted because other people or other circumstances have left you on hold. While you feel resistant, it’s important that you surrender to ‘what is’ and let go of your attachment to how things should be. Be in flow with life, even if it’s not as you expected it (seriously, when does it ever go exactly as you expected!?), and loosen your grip.</p><p>If your life has already been on pause for a period, the reversed Hanged Man may come as a positive sign that you can now move forward with a new perspective and a renewed sense of energy. You may find that events line up with more ease and flow, and you’re ready to go again. There may have been a break-through or stark realisation about how you need to do things differently. You’re prepared to make those changes and move ahead with a new mindset.</p><p>In a reading where a relationship is on hold, the Hanged Man reversed suggests that you are content to wait around… to a point. You realise that this relationship will evolve and, due to its complexities, you cannot rush it. However, you also do not want to wait forever, and you acknowledge that there will come a time when you must decide.</p><p>The reversed Hanged Man can also signal that you are stalling a decision or action. You may think you’re waiting until you feel 100% ready – but guess what? You’re probably never going to be 100% ready. So, what are you waiting for? Take the leap! Make that decision! Do it before the Universe decides it can’t wait for you.</p>"

    "name": "Death",
    "id": "death",
    "img": "images/death.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Death card is probably the most feared and misunderstood of all the cards in the Tarot deck. Just the mention of the card’s name has people shaking in their boots! In general, people tend to take the meaning of this card far too literally and fear that the indication is for the death of either themselves or others. Relax! The card of Death can be one of the most fruitful and positive cards in the deck.</p><p>Death is symbolic of the ending of a major phase or aspect of your life that may bring about the beginning of something far more valuable and important. You must close one door in order to open another. You need to put the past behind you and part ways, ready to embrace new opportunities and possibilities. It may be difficult to let go of the past at times but you will soon see how important it is so that you can bring renewal and transformation into your life. If you resist these necessary endings, you may experience pain, both emotionally and physically but if you exercise your creative imagination and visualise a new possibility, you allow more constructive patterns to emerge.</p><p>Similarly, Death indicates a time of significant transformation, change and transition. You need to profoundly transform yourself and clear away any of the old in order to bring in the new. Any change at this time should be welcomed as a positive, cleansing, transformative force in your life. The death and clearing away of limiting factors can open the door to a wider, more satisfying experience of life.</p><p>The Death card contains elements of a sudden and unexpected change. You may feel as though you are caught in the path of sweeping change and cannot escape its effects. Though the immediate thought is toward the negative, an end need not mean failure. The loss could be a series of unexpected surprises that bring an end to a period of turmoil or problems. You feel you can no longer go along with the status quo and want things to change radically. Many changes are going to take place to enable a new direction to emerge.</p><p>Finally, Death is an indication that you need to learn to let go of unhealthy attachments in your life to pave the way to a fuller, more fulfilled life of deeper meaning and significance. Death teaches you to let go of outworn and outgrown ways of life and move forward. This is a perfect card to use to break a bad habit or pattern of behaviour. This is a time of eliminating excess and cutting out what is not necessary in your life. This may be a good time to purge old belongings, memories and ‘baggage’ that is getting in your way.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>Upright, Death is a card of transformation and typically refers to needing to start over by letting go of the past. In the reversed position, Death can mean that you are on the verge of meaningful change but are resisting it. You may be reluctant to let go, or you may not know how to make the change you need. You still carry harmful viewpoints from the past that may interfere with a new opportunity. Because of your refusal, life has stagnated, and you feel stuck in limbo.</p><p>Death reversed offers you the opportunity to embrace change rather than resist it. See what wonderful possibilities become available to you as you say ‘yes’ to change. As you learn to release the past and surrender to the present, the future becomes even brighter. To support the process, repeat this affirmation: “I embrace change in all forms.” You’ll be surprised at how this subtle shift in energy allows new doors to open in ways you may never have expected.</p><p>On a deeper level, the reversed Death card can show that you are going through a massive personal transformation, often in private and out of view from others. You are releasing what no longer serves you so that you can make space for the new to emerge. Draw a follow-up card to understand better what you need to release and purge, or examine the other cards in the reading. You may be removing fear and limiting beliefs; you may be changing your habits; or, you may undergo a physical purging and transformation with plant medicine or other spiritual healing. You may not want to share this with others just yet – wait until your personal transformation has occurred, then share your story as a source of inspiration.</p>"

    "name": "Temperance",
    "id": "temperance",
    "img": "images/temperance.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>Temperance indicates that you are learning to bring about balance, patience and moderation in your life. You have been able to take the middle road, avoiding extremes and maintaining a great sense of calm in your life. You have learned to keep calm in situations of great stress or anxiety, and you give the impression of being a swan, paddling madly underneath the water but appearing so graceful and elegant on the surface. You do not let things get to you, and you have found a place of peace where you can put things into perspective when things get hectic. Your respect for balance and tranquillity is what will help you to achieve and experience fulfilment in your life. Your temperament will be well balanced and you demonstrate good management and balance in your outlook on life.</p><p>The Temperance card reflects that you have a clear, long-term vision of what you want to achieve. You are not rushing things along; rather you are taking your time to ensure that you do the best job you can. This card also reflects a higher learning in what you are doing and demonstrates that you are learning a great deal on your journey. You are at peace with what you are doing and it is all coming together very well. Your inner voice is guiding you gently to the right outcome and you are patiently listening and following. You have a very balanced perspective on the situation at this time and you are in a very good position to make the right choices.</p><p>In relation to others, Temperance represents adaptation, coordination, and tempering external influences. You are able to work in harmony with others and there is a heightened level of co-operation in your activities with others. You are able to combine forces and join with others in order to bring it all together. There is a beautiful synergy at work that leverages the right mix of talents, experiences, abilities and skills.</p><p>Temperance asks you to be patient so that you can act with timing and precision. Patience and moderation will result in good management of all things. Do not feel that you need to rush, just let the situation evolve at its natural pace.</p><p>Temperance can also reflect a period of self-evaluation in order to re-examine your life priorities. You are now seeking a much greater balance between your inner and outer selves, searching for a higher meaning and purpose in life. Throughout this transition, you may also experience a clash between the old and the new you, sometimes feeling confused about which direction you ought to take and what is really important to you. You will evaluate seclusion, detachment and retreats as methods for accomplishing great things. You will avoid pain, conflict and distractions and lessen your stress and anxiety. Looking inward will re-charge you. There is nothing to fear, it is part of the process and without it change could not occur.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>If you have recently experienced a period of excess, the reversed Temperance card is your invitation (or sometimes, your warning signal) to restore balance and moderation as soon as possible. You may have been over-eating, regularly drinking, buying things you can’t afford, arguing with loved ones, or engaging in negative thought patterns. These activities are taking you further away from who you are and what you are here to do. So, it is time to stop. As they say, “Everything in moderation!” Or, you may find you need 100% abstinence to break this negative cycle and bring your life back into balance again.</p><p>The reversed Temperance card can also be a sign you sense that something is ‘off’ in your life, creating stress and tension. Life is not flowing as easily as you had hoped or there’s a niggling voice from within going, “Wait a second! This doesn’t feel right!” You can ignore it and carry on with life as usual. But, heed Temperance’s warning: If you stay in this state for too long, that voice will just get louder and louder until you pay attention. Or, you can listen to it now and make the necessary adjustments to find your flow once again. Focus on your long-term vision and higher purpose and seek to align your daily activities with this vision.</p><p>Temperance reversed may reflect a period of self-evaluation in which you can re-examine your life priorities. Internally, you may feel called in one direction, but your daily life may not match up to what is emerging. See this as your opportunity to align your higher vibration with your outer world. You may need to change your living arrangements, relationships, career, and daily habits so you can cultivate more balance and purpose in line with your new priorities. Don’t be surprised if you run into tension or even conflict as you align your inner and outer worlds; it’s a natural part of the process of levelling up and creating positive change.</p><p>Similarly, the reversed Temperance card can be a call for profound self-healing. By creating more balance and moderation in your life, you open the possibility for such healing to occur. Given the reversal of this card, you are doing it in a way that is personal and private to you, without the influence of others. You know you have what you need to heal yourself and create more ‘flow’ in your life.</p>"

    "name": "The Devil",
    "id": "devil",
    "img": "images/devil.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The card of the Devil represents the hidden forces of negativity that constrain you and that trick you into thinking you are imprisoned by external forces ultimately out of your control. The Devil is an inner force within each of us. He represents our fears, addictions, and other harmful impulses. He is a master of deception and creates the illusion that you are involuntarily bound to him. However, the figures in this card are free to remove the chains from around their necks, indicating that they have freely given the Devil any power he has over them.</p><p>When you see the Devil in a reading, ask yourself where you are feeling stuck or restricted in your life. You may be tricked into believing that you are being controlled by external forces when in fact you have created your own chains of imprisonment and powerlessness. A sense of hopelessness can accompany the Devil. You feel despair and have a pessimistic view of life because you feel that so much is outside of your control. You fear the worst, and this means that your fears have a hold over you and prevent you from leading a more fulfilling and optimistic life. What are the addictions or attachments restraining you from experiencing the freedom of the Fool? Are you giving yourself over to the illusion of helplessness and despair? Know that you have the power within to free yourself from the bondage of the Devil.</p><p>The Devil often reflects actual addictions and dependencies in your life, such as alcoholism, drug-taking, unhealthy relationships, over-spending and the like. You think you need something and you are willing to go against what you know to be right and true in order to obtain it. You need to break free of these negative patterns of behaviour by acknowledging the hold that they have over you and the negative impact they are having on your life. Often they are behaviours that are immediately gratifying but which cause longer-term damage to your inner fulfilment.</p> <p>More generally, the Devil indicates that you are becoming obsessed and hell-bent on a particular idea, situation or endeavour. You are over-investing yourself in one area at the expense of other areas of your life. Often, the Devil card represents an over-dependence on material wealth. You may have become so fixated on becoming a millionaire or owning a fancy car that you have forgotten the importance of investing in your relationships or yourself. You have generated a belief that value lies in how much you earn or how much you own. You have created an unhealthy bond with these materialistic desires and you are now being controlled by this bondage.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed Devil card can often appear when you are on the verge of a break-through or an up-levelling. You are being called to your highest potential, but first, you must let go of any unhealthy attachments or limiting beliefs that may hold you back. Often, when you are called to something ‘more’, you must deal with your shadows before you can step into this new version of yourself. It may be an addiction, unhealthy relationships, or a disengaging career. Let go of fear and release any self-imposed limiting beliefs standing in the way of your growth. It is easier than you realise.</p><p>The reversed Devil calls on you to confront your inner fears and anxieties to free yourself from the chains that bind you to your limiting beliefs and unhealthy attachments. Eliminate those things you know are harmful to you and your inner psyche. It may be about creating a healthier diet, watching less television, quitting smoking, spending more time with your loved ones, or focusing more on your goals. Take this opportunity to bring about positive change in your life by staying focused on the ultimate goal of freedom.</p><p>The Devil reversed can also appear when you are going into your deepest, darkest places – whether or not you are ready. When you take this path consciously, you do so with strength, confidence and courage. You seek to understand your innermost shadows so you can either release them or integrate them into your life in a more constructive way. When you do it unconsciously, or with resistance, it can be very confronting as you may begin to realise you are very different from who you thought you were. You may enter a period of anxiety or depression, or experiencing dark thoughts you struggle to understand. If this resonates, then please seek out a trained therapist to help you work through this time.</p><p>The reversed Devil may also be a sign you are hiding your deepest, darkest self from others, keeping it a secret. You may have thoughts, fantasies, addictions, or habits that you don’t want others to know because you feel embarrassed or ashamed. But sometimes, holding onto the secrets can contribute to a growing level of guilt, and you may feel a sense of relief if you can share your darker self with at least one trusted individual. There is also a need to accept who you are and forgive yourself for the thoughts you have. Of course, if you are at risk of harming yourself or others, please seek professional help immediately.</p><p>Finally, the Devil reversed invites you to practice the Buddhist principle of detachment, a state in which you overcome your attachment to the desire for things, people or concepts of the world, and free yourself from any restrictions. It doesn’t mean you don’t care for people or things; you release your dependence on them. You may also find that a cord-cutting visualisation helps to release any unhealthy attachments to others, especially when the Devil reversed appears in a Tarot reading.</p>"

    "name": "The Tower",
    "id": "tower",
    "img": "images/tower.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>How many times have you sat safely within the narrow confines of your life, comfortable in your current thoughts, beliefs and expectations? Then, out of the blue, something ‘shocking’ happens that completely destroys your picture of peace and harmony. It blows your mind or throws you for a loop. There is a sudden realisation that your comfort was based on an inadequate foundation of false thought, belief and action. This is a humbling, frightening but necessary experience.</p><p>When you see the Tower in a reading, you may feel afraid, shaken and insecure. It is a time of great turmoil and destruction as you seek to understand how you could have been so wrong, so naive, or so blind about a particularly situation. And now, what will you do and how will you manage in the face of this shocking truth? You may be experiencing sleepless nights, depression, grief, anger and confrontation. These are normal reactions to major changes in your outer and inner worlds.</p><p>A Tower experience is any experience that shakes the foundation of your current sense of security and/or forces you to question your strongly-held beliefs, perceptions, attitudes and behaviours. It may be a divorce, death of a loved one, financial failure, health problems or job loss, or any event that penetrates to the core of your inner being, affecting you spiritually, mentally and physically. It is often descriptive of a major upheaval, disruption, emergency or crisis, and is likely to bring chaos in the aftermath of such an event.</p><p>If the Tower appears in your reading, ask yourself, “What structures in my life are breaking up?” No doubt you will already be very aware of where there is turmoil and destruction but sometimes it can be on a more subtle or subconscious level.</p><p>The most important aspect of the Tower is that with any destruction there comes creation. Thus, the Tower card represents an awakening and is about inspiration, freedom, reality and the release from bondage. It is a truth and honesty card that comes as a bolt of lightning to you through a shocking and impactful life event. It represents a necessary experience that forces you to get out of your comfort zone and to grow beyond your present level. The sudden destruction of the Tower represents the immediacy of change, and the often disorienting effects of that change. Once you hit rock bottom the choice is yours. You can revert to the self-defeating, restrictive Devil, or reach for the transformational and inspirational Star. When you begin to reach for the Star, you will come to realise that your true security and strength lies within yourself and your relationship with the Universe, and not in some false belief system or artificially-created world. Following a Tower experience, you can rest assured that you will grow stronger, wiser and more serene as you begin to develop a completely new perspective on life that you did not even know existed. These moments in time are necessary for spiritual growth and enlightenment. Truth and honesty will bring about a positive change, even if you must experience pain and anxiety throughout the process.</p><p>The Tower also represents the inner and outer structures that you have built. These structures represent your personal defences, defences that create a more socially acceptable ‘you’ by hiding your true, inner thoughts and feelings. It is like laughing politely when your boss tells a joke, or, on a deeper level, disguising your sexual feelings, particularly if you feel that they are socially inappropriate. In times of great pressure and stress, these structures will be tested and are at risk of shattering, finally revealing your true inner self to those around you. So, you need to be very careful how much of yourself you attempt to hide, knowing that one day, all will be revealed.</p><p>The Tower therefore asks you to break down the structures that you have surrounded yourself with. This can be a painful and difficult process if you resist against the external forces that are pushing you to reveal more of yourself. Breaking through this pretence can cause a great deal of anguish but remember that the Tower will fall, whether you like it or not, because you have reached your limits in this area and can no longer live with it.</p><p>Similarly, the Tower can signify your ego and the illusion of considering yourself to be superior to others. When the Tower of ego, deception and illusion is destroyed, you are free to face truth and reality without the trappings of false attachments. Are you undergoing a major shift in consciousness? Are you beginning to see things in a new way? Embrace the opportunity to accept change and move forward into a more positive psychological state, where personal freedom is the rule.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Tower reversed suggests that you are undergoing a significant personal transformation and upheaval. This differs from the experience of the upright Tower where the change is often because of external circumstances and may even feel forced upon you. Instead, with the reversed Tower card, you are instigating the change and calling into question your fundamental belief systems, values, purpose and meaning. You may go through a spiritual awakening as you discover a new spiritual path. You may change your beliefs and opinions about important topics, realising that you can no longer support older models. Or, in more dramatic cases, you may go through an existential crisis where you seriously question your life’s purpose. While this can be an unsettling time, trust in the process and know it is for the best. You are creating change and transformation so you can step into a new and evolved version of yourself.</p><p>At times, the reversed Tower can be a sign that you are resisting change and delaying the necessary destruction and upheaval. You may be in denial that change is occurring. Or you may be clinging to an old belief system even though you know they are no longer relevant or healthy for you. As much as you don’t want to, you need to go through this difficult time to learn a valuable lesson and make progress in your life. And know that if you continue to resist this change, it will only force its way into your life even more. The growth and transformation that the Tower card brings are inevitable. No amount of hiding or denying will make it go away, and it will only get louder with potentially greater upheaval.</p><p>Finally, the reversal of the Tower can reduce the impact of the change about to enter your life, particularly if you are tuned in to your intuition. You may be forewarned or have an intuitive sense that something big is about to happen, and you can plan ahead to avoid (or minimise) the destruction that lies ahead.</p>"

    "name": "The Star",
    "id": "star",
    "img": "images/star.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Star Tarot card brings renewed hope and faith and a sense that you are truly blessed by the Universe at this time. Courage, fulfilment, and inspiration are in your life. You are entering a loving phase in your life, filled with calm energy, mental stability and deeper understanding of both yourself and others around you. This card is saying to you that, over the long-term, you should have faith and trust in the Universe. A better future is waiting for you but in order to reach it you must trust that it is indeed possible.</p><p>As it follows the Tower, the meaning of the Star Tarot card suggests that you have endured life’s challenges and have been through a difficult time but you are now open to healing and transformation. Your ability to let go of damaging memories has been strengthened by contact with your true self through these difficult times. Hatred, envy, bitterness, and revenge have burned themselves out and no longer shadow your life or get in the way of your potential for future happiness. You are now also able to forgive and forget so that you can embrace new opportunities.</p><p>The Star card is therefore an important card for personal transformation. When the Star appears in a Tarot reading, be open to new ideas and growth. Listen to the still small voice within. You have a strong desire now to find or rediscover a sense of meaning, inspiration, or purpose in your life. You are making some significant changes in your life, transforming yourself from the old you to the new you, and in doing this you are bringing about a fresh perspective on life. You may also be feeling that you are finally honouring the person who you truly are or want to be, rather than simply following a routine that has little meaning to you. There is a deeper spiritual journey that you are going through which is all about bringing greater meaning and purpose into your life and renewing your inner energy. You hope your future will be better than your past. This card is the call of destiny that motivates you or compels you to go on. Your desire is not in vain as you will ultimately find what you are yearning for.</p><p>In a Tarot reading, the Star brings renewed self-esteem and increased trust in yourself. You will become aware of how successful and respected you are. You may attain a goal that brings lasting happiness and your reputation may be enhanced. The Star Tarot card is particularly encouraging when you have come through a period of opposition, negative feedback or setbacks that have previously damaged your self-esteem. The Star encourages you to have faith in yourself and to believe in yourself.</p><p>The Star Tarot card also indicates a generous spirit. You want to give or share your wealth with others to help transform their own lives. You have an open heart and you now want to give back the blessings you have already received so that others may benefit.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed Star card can mean that you’ve lost faith and hope in the Universe. You may be feeling overwhelmed by life’s challenges right now and questioning why you are being put through this. You know life throws curveballs, but really? Why this, and why now?! You may be desperately calling out to the Universe to give you some reprieve but struggling to see how the Divine is on your side. Look harder, and you will see it. The Divine is always there. Take a moment to ask yourself what the deeper life lesson is, and how this is a blessing, not a punishment.</p><p>Often, the reversed Star is a test of faith. When confronted with a challenging situation, you can either crumble like the Tower or stand firm in your conviction that the Divine is everywhere. You will also learn how to trust not only in the Universe but also in yourself. You are a vessel for the Divine, and when you have faith and confidence in yourself, you allow the Divine to shine through.</p><p>The Star reversed also shows that you are disengaged and uninspired with life or components of your life (for example, work, hobbies, relationships, personal projects, etc.). Perhaps you started out with great vision and enthusiasm, but you are now finding yourself overwhelmed by day-to-day routines that are boring and dreary. This card is particularly relevant for career readings when you feel disconnected from the work you do and wonder if it’s time to move on or make a change. Reconnect to what is truly important to you and your soul’s purpose for this lifetime. Align your daily life with this purpose, and you will find new sources of inspiration.</p><p>The reversed Star urges you to take time out for self-care and nourishment on a deeply personal and spiritual level. Your energy reserves may be well and truly depleted, so rather than pushing yourself even further, make time just for you. Book a massage, reconnect to your daily spiritual practices, take a warm bath – whatever it takes to nurture your spirit and reconnect with your inner essence. Being near water or engaging in a purification ritual will help to nourish you on a deeper level.</p>"

    "name": "The Moon",
    "id": "moon",
    "img": "images/moon.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Moon often represents your ‘shadow’ self. The shadow is a psychological term introduced by the late Swiss psychiatrist Dr. Carl G. Jung, and is a part of the unconscious mind consisting of repressed weaknesses, shortcomings and instincts. “Everyone carries a shadow,” Jung wrote, “and the less it is embodied in the individual’s conscious life, the blacker and denser it is” (cited in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_%28psychology%29). According to Jung, the shadow, in being instinctive and irrational, is prone to projection, turning a personal inferiority into a perceived moral deficiency in someone else. Thus the Moon calls your attention to your shadow, becoming consciously aware of any tendencies to project fear and anxiety onto your external surroundings, and turning it around into more positive and constructive energy.</p><p>The Moon is a psychological card of projecting fear into your present and your future, based on past experiences. The images, thoughts and feelings that you have repressed over time cause inner disturbances that are becoming overwhelming. As a result, you are now experiencing negative blocks within your personality, causing fear and anxiety. To remedy this, you need to go through a purging process whereby deep memories are released. This is a time when you need to go deep into your soul and dredge up your anxieties, fears, psychic blocks and personality disturbances. Many invisible things are coming to the surface including secret motives, clandestine information and ancient hidden truths. These newly discovered resources may confuse you but once they are brought to your awareness, they will no longer haunt you.</p><p>The Moon is a card of illusion and deception, and therefore often suggests a time when something is not as it appears to be. Vigilance and clear perception will be necessary to find that which is hidden before it is too late. If other cards in the reading are negative, then the Moon shows that not all is as wonderful as you would think and there are still hidden forces at play that may unravel your success. You may be idealising the situation, and ignoring the fact that potential for failure exists among success. If the other cards are generally positive, then the Moon suggests that you are letting your imagination run away with you, and that things are not nearly as bad as they seem. In both cases you must open your eyes and see what it really going on. Guard against accepting illusions as they may cause an error in your judgement.</p><p>Oftentimes, the Moon appears in a reading when you are not sure of your destination, or even of the path you are travelling but you travel nonetheless. You may have lost your way and are now left to walk in the dark, guided only by your inner light and intuition. You need to go on without a clear picture of where you are, where you are going or where you have been. The Moon is a card of intuition and psychic forces, so let go of your conscious mental blocks or negative self-talk, and allow your intuition to guide you. Your dreams, intuitions, and inner promptings lead you forward toward higher levels of understanding if you listen carefully and use your judgement to help interpret the veiled messages of the unconscious. Not only will the way forward be revealed but in many cases you will learn lessons about yourself that will be valuable in later journeys.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Moon reversed indicates that you have been dealing with illusion, fears and anxiety, and now the negative influences of these energies are subsiding. You are working through your fears and anxieties, understanding the impact they have on your life and how you can free yourself from such limiting beliefs. This is a truly liberating and transformational experience.</p><p>You may try to bury these feelings even deeper within your subconscious so you can avoid your dark shadows. You may not be ready to face your emotions, pushing them to the side and pretending as if nothing is wrong. This strategy might work in the short-term, but eventually, you will need to resurface these emotions and deal with them head-on.</p><p>The Moon reversed can also show that you are receiving intuitive messages and psychic downloads but are struggling to understand what they mean for you. The message may be confusing, or your interpretation differs from what you read elsewhere. When the Moon is reversed, you are being called to listen to your inner voice, and not the voice of someone else. Trust that the answers you need are already within you, and tune in to your inner guidance system to hear those answers. Pay attention to your dreams and keep a dream diary because this is how many of your subconscious messages will be relayed to you. If you’re still stuck, record the messages you receive and come back to them later when you have more clarity.</p>"

    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Sun represents success, radiance and abundance. The Sun gives you strength and tells you that no matter where you go or what you do, your positive and radiant energy will follow you and will bring you happiness and joy. People are drawn to you because you can always see the bright side and you bring such warmth into other people’s lives. This beautiful, warm energy is what will get you through the tough times and will help you succeed. You are also in a position where you can share your highest qualities and achievements with others. Radiate who you are and what you stand for. Shine love on those you care about.</p><p>You have an innate sense of confidence right now. Life is good, the sun is shining and you are on your way to achieving your goals. The Sun represents that feeling of getting up on Saturday morning, with the whole weekend ahead of you, and you open the curtains with the sun shining on your face. Having struggled through the shadow sides you now know yourself and know where you are heading, and the sun illuminates your path.</p><p>The Sun is a ‘yes’ to life! It brings with it luck, wellness, positive consciousness, enthusiasm, attainment and success. It is about embracing your destiny and giving it everything you have got. If you have been having a difficult time, the Sun brings you the message you have been waiting for – that things are going to get better – a lot better! You know that the rain clouds will soon give way to the rays of the sun and you will feel warmed to the soul once again. The Sun is also an energetic card. It reflects a time when you can expect to experience an increase in physical energy, vitality and general positivity. You are bursting with enthusiasm, feeling invigorated and enjoying a wonderful sense of good health.</p><p>The Sun reflects the value of simplicity. No elaborate scheming is required but instead, plain and simple is the best option. Experience the freedom and liberation associated with living the simple life and doing what you enjoy most. Get back to the simple pleasures such as spending time with loved ones, getting back to nature, or simply reading a book in your garden! Expect a boost in the right direction and trust that work can and will be done, with relative little effort.</p><p>This is a time when you will feel enlightened. You can finally see the path ahead of you and through the hardship you have endured, you have attained a new level of insight and understanding. You may have even had a personal or intellectual breakthrough where you have finally unlocked the key to your fundamental ‘being’.</p><p>On a very literal level, the Sun can indicate travel to a warm or tropical climate where you can finally bask in the sun and enjoy the warm rays!</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed Sun is calling to your inner child to come out and play! As adults, we get so lost in the hustle and bustle of everyday life that we forget how to have fun. But spend just a few minutes watching a kid play, and you realise how wonderful and carefree life can be when you learn to let go of your worries and concerns. When you see the Sun reversed in your Tarot reading, see it as your permission slip to leave behind your work and responsibilities, even just for a moment, and play. Dance like no-one is watching, sing like no-one is listening, and let your heart and soul fly free.</p><p>The Sun reversed can mean you are struggling to see the bright side of life. You may have experienced setbacks that damaged your enthusiasm and optimism and perhaps led you to question whether you can achieve what you set out to do. You may feel depressed or left out and are no longer enjoying what you are doing. Your direction and path ahead may appear clouded or distorted.</p><p>Nonetheless, the Sun is never a negative card, so this is only temporary. The obstacles you see can be easily removed if you put your mind to it. It may just take a bit more effort than usual.</p><p>On the other hand, you may be too confident or overly optimistic. While you are confident, you may have become egotistical and out of touch with what you can achieve. Are you truthful to yourself and others? Or, are you trying to talk yourself up when you know you cannot deliver? If this resonates with you, then ask others for feedback and a reality check. Are you unrealistic? Is what you have set out to achieve achievable? Are you really as good as you think you are?</p>"

    "name": "Judgement",
    "id": "judgement",
    "img": "images/judgement.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Judgement card calls for a period of reflection and self-evaluation. Through meditation or quiet reflection, you may come to a point of deep understanding about the common themes throughout your life and what you can do or change to avoid these situations in the future. Judgement tells you that you are close to reaching a significant stage in your own journey.</p><p>The Judgement card suggests that you have had a recent epiphany or an ‘awakening’ where you have come to a realisation that you need to live your life in a different way and you need to be true to yourself and your needs. You have opened yourself up to a new possibility – to lead a fulfilling life that serves your higher needs and that offers inspiration and hope to others. You feel as though you have had a ‘calling’ in life, and you are getting much closer to the point where you need to take action. Something that was lying dormant within you, some unconscious knowledge or truth is finally being awakened and brought into the light.</p><p>With its theme of awakening to new life, the Judgement card suggests that you have reviewed and evaluated your past experiences and have learned from them. All the pieces of the puzzle of your life are finally coming together to form one, integrated picture of your life story. This integration has healed any deep wounds and you are now in a position to put the past behind you. Your memories no longer haunt you, and you are able to understand and value what has happened to you and what it has taught you about life. Now, you are ready to confront any unfinished business in your life, clear up any misunderstandings and view the future with peace and deep ‘knowingness’ in your heart.</p><p>Judgement is about finding absolution. Through a period of self-evaluation, you will feel cleansed of your ‘sins’, wrongdoings and mistakes, and you will finally be released of your guilt and sorrow about the past. This represents a wonderful purging process and will leave you feeling refreshed and ready to take on any new challenges.</p><p>The Judgement card often indicates that life-changing decisions are required but unlike those associated with the logical Justice card, these decisions require a delicate blend of intuition and intellect. You may be at a crossroads, aware that any decision that you make will bring about significant change. The choice can be an obvious one, or perhaps the only viable one. You know that this choice must be made and you are facing it with maturity and level-headedness. Your own judgement is impeccable at this time; you can trust it completely and know that you are on the right path. If you still require clarity on the situation, look to your past experiences and life lessons which will guide you on the right path.</p><p>If you have endured challenges in recent times, then the Judgement card suggests that you may have some respite from these challenges. In fact, you may find comfort in sharing your experiences with others and healing within a group environment. The key here is that there will be others who have experienced something similar to you and who can show you the way to freedom from your troubles. Let them guide you and help you.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>Judgement reversed calls for a period of reflection and self-evaluation. Through meditation or quiet contemplation, you may arrive at a deep understanding of the universal themes weaving throughout your life and what you can do or change to avoid these situations. You may have kept them secret or hidden because you fear how others may judge you. To clear these past mistakes and regrets, and any associated guilt or shame, work on your self-forgiveness, self-acceptance, self-love, and release and freedom.</p><p>The Judgement reversed often appears when the Universe is trying to send you a message and invite you to something bigger, but you’re not listening. Maybe you’re afraid of the sacrifice you will need to make to heed the call, or you’re worried you are not ready to step into a more prominent role and just want to play it safe. You are doing your best to pretend you didn’t receive it and are carrying on with your daily life, hoping it will go away. But let’s be honest – the ‘call’ never goes away; it just gets louder and louder until you pay attention. It’s time to push past your inner fears and self-doubt, and trust that the Universe has your back. This is happening for a reason.</p><p>Sometimes, the reversed Judgement indicates your inner critic is coming through, loud and clear. You may doubt yourself or tell yourself negative messages. This is impeding you being able to fulfil your highest potential and be your best self. To overcome your inner critic, see it as a separate part of yourself (give it a name), hear it out and acknowledge its fear, and offer assurances that everything will be just fine. With focused discipline, you can break the cycle of self-criticism and replace it with more positive messages of what is possible.</p>"

    "name": "The World",
    "id": "world",
    "img": "images/world.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The World signifies completion, achievement and fulfilment. All of your efforts are finally paying off and you have reached the end of a journey or have completed a major life cycle. You have endured hardships and challenges along the way but these have only made you stronger and significantly wiser and more experienced than when you first started on your journey.</p><p>A long-term project, period of study, relationship, or career has come full circle and you are now feeling a sense of closure as well as achievement and accomplishment. It could represent a graduation, a marriage, the birth of a child (representing the end of a pregnancy), or the attainment of a long held dream or aspiration. You have finally accomplished your goal or purpose. Everything has come together, and you are in the right place, doing the right thing, achieving what you have envisioned, and feeling fulfilled and complete. In this sense, the World card also heralds new beginnings that naturally emerge out of the completion cycle.</p><p>There will also be well-earned praise, celebration and success for your achievements, and if there is not, then you had better organise something because you have worked incredibly hard to get here! All of your hard work, devotion, and planning has finally paid off and it is well worth celebrating!If you have not quite reached this point of completion, you are very close! You need to attain a degree of understanding that enables you to graduate to a higher level and enjoy real success. This rare time of culmination must be identified and honoured. Look at the past month / six months / year and think about how far you have come and what you have achieved. You may be quite surprised at your progress and how much you have worked towards completing the cycle of success. You may also see the projects you are currently working on have even better results than expected.</p><p>The World also represents a period where you can see the entire process or system for what it is and you understand your place within that system. This card is about a deeper understanding of your role and your impact within a certain environment and where you truly ‘fit’. This card can also point to a strong feeling of unity and wholeness with the world or in a particular situation. Everything is starting to fall into place and you can be ‘one’ with the situation.</p><p>You will be more involved in your community or interests. You have a strong desire to contribute, to ‘give back’, or to use a special gift or talent to help make the world a better place. You are coming from a good place now of love, knowledge and experience and you are ready to share this with others.</p><p>From a more literal perspective, the World can indicate world travel, particularly on a large scale. You may be lucky enough to be embarking on a six month overseas trip, or are working/studying/living overseas for an extended period of time. Similarly, this card reinforces universal understanding and global awareness. Wherever you will go, you will encounter new experiences and welcoming hosts who will embrace you and invite you into their worlds.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed World card suggests that you are seeking closure on a personal issue. Perhaps you are still emotionally attached to a past relationship and want to move on. Or you dream of the day you can fit into your old skinny jeans but realise now that your metabolism and body shape changed in the last ten years. You know, deep down, that to accept and embrace where you are now, you need to let go of the past and move on. Finding closure may be an intensely personal journey – something you manage through journaling, visualisation, energy work, and therapy.</p><p>The World reversed can signify that you want to fulfil a big goal or complete a big project, but you’re not taking all the steps necessary to get there. You may opt for the easiest or quickest path to attain your goal, but it won't lead to the outcome you intend. Climbing a mountain from the bottom up is an entirely different experience from getting a helicopter ride to the peak, even though the destination is the same. You need to experience the trials and tribulations along the way so you can learn and grow. And when you do reach your goal, you will enjoy such a fantastic sense of achievement. Don’t be afraid to set stretch goals for yourself, even if it means enduring hardships or challenges along the way; it will make the victory even sweeter.</p><p>The reversed World can also indicate a time when you are close to finishing a project or goal, but for whatever reason, you lose focus and slack off right at the end. You only have a short way to go, so why stop now? Re-energise and remind yourself how wonderful life will be when you get the thing you’ve wanted for so long.</p><p>Sometimes, the reversed World can mean a frustrating delay in completing your projects. You might miss an essential piece, and you won’t find closure until it gets worked out. You may need to get more creative to figure out how to touch the finish line.</p>"

    "img": "images/aceofcups.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>With the Ace of Cups, Divine love and compassion is flowing through you. You are a vessel for deep, spiritual love from the Universe, and you can’t help but let that love flow through you and into the world around you. You receive love, you give love, you ARE love. Your heart overflows with love.</p><p>This is the perfect time for you to open your heart to love and experience the abundant flow of emotion that is available to you right now. You are more receptive to creative opportunities, loving connections, and deep compassion for other living beings. As with all Aces in the Tarot, this card comes as an invitation – will you take it? Will you say “Yes!” to the Divine love and compassion that is available to you, and will you run with it? It has the potential for spiritual and emotional fulfilment – but only if you embrace it with an open heart.</p><p>The Ace of Cups often appears in Tarot readings when you are open to the possibility of creative expression, especially where you can allow your emotions to shine through your creative endeavours. You are open to experiencing your inner feelings and sharing them with others, through your creative work. You may be inspired to start a new creative project, take up an art class or two or even engage in interpretative dance. You are at that point in your life where you feel comfortable with who you are and what you feel, and you are not afraid to express that part of yourself to others. You see new potential in allowing your creative juices to flow, and as such you are open to new possibilities and stimulating your imagination to allow your talent to unfold.</p><p>The Ace of Cups often represents the beginning of a new relationship, be it a friendship, new family connection or blossoming romance. This is one of those relationships where you feel butterflies in your stomach, and you are so pleased to have met someone with whom you can share a special connection. The water in the card reflects the flow of emotion, and thus, the Ace of Cups suggests that positive emotion and energy will be created between two people in a way that leaves you feeling good about yourself and life in general. Give yourself permission to fully open yourself up to giving and receiving unconditional love, and you will also notice that love flows easily and effortlessly when you are in this loving state of mind.</p><p>There is certainly a generous, compassionate component to the Ace of Cups. This is a time of giving, not taking, and offering yourself to a new opportunity to help others. You have the power to bring great happiness to others and share your inner radiance and positive energy. You will also find that the more you give, the more you receive on multiple levels.</p><p>Finally, the Ace of Cups can indicate conception, pregnancy or birth. Look to other cards in the reading for further confirmation, such as the Empress, Page of Cups or Four of Wands. On a more metaphorical level, there may be the birth of a new idea or a spark of new inspiration. It can represent the beginning of a project in which a great deal of loving and creative energy is invested.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>In the upright position, the Ace of Cups is about love for all things. In the reversed position, it is about love for oneself. Yes, this is the self-love card of the Tarot deck! Before you send your love out to the world, you are sending love to yourself, filling up every cell in your body with Divine love and happiness. And the more you do this, the more you allow yourself to be in flow with life itself.</p><p>The reversed Ace of Cups is also a sign that you are in connection with your subconscious mind and in tune with your intuition. You are exploring this part of yourself privately, and discovering how you can bring more intuition and flow into your life.</p><p>On the flipside, the Ace of Cups reversed may be a sign that you are repressing your emotions, not wanting to express yourself fully to the outside world. Instead, you are keeping your feelings to yourself and not wanting others to know what’s truly going on inside. You may feel embarrassed, ashamed or afraid of what might happen if you were to express your emotions. You may be anxious that if you allow your feelings to flow, the flow may turn quickly into an overwhelming flood and you may not know how to switch it off. However, be careful that you do not create an internal blockage by repressing your feelings. If you are not ready to publicly share your emotions, you can find ways to release them privately, through journaling, creative projects, movement, or screaming your frustration and anger out in the car.</p><p>In a relationship reading, the reversed Ace of Cups can indicate that you are withholding your emotions for fear of getting hurt. You know that for the relationship to move forward and flow freely, you must eventually trust in your partner but, for the time being, you are holding back.</p>"

    "img": "images/twoofcups.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>If the Ace of Cups represents the flow of love from within, the Two of Cups represents the flow of love between two people. With this card, you are creating deep connections and partnerships, based on shared values, compassion, and unconditional love. While these relationships are still in the early stages, they have the potential to grow and develop into something that is deeply fulfilling and rewarding in the long-term. There is a mutual respect and appreciation for one another, and together you reach higher planes of consciousness and understanding.</p><p>When the Two of Cups card appears in a Tarot reading, you may be entering a new partnership, perhaps with a lover, friend or business partner. You are both focused on creating a relationship that is mutually beneficial and that will create a win-win situation for both parties. You see ‘eye to eye’ and appreciate what each other is able to bring to the table.</p><p>As a romantic relationship, the Two of Cups indicates a blossoming new relationship based on mutual attraction. There is both a physical and soul connection that leaves you feeling giddy and weak at the knees. You bring out the best in each other and lift each other up to even higher levels of potential. There is a heartfelt exchange of emotion, and you are both willing to do whatever it takes to support one another. In some cases, the Two of Cups can also refer to a marriage, proposal or engagement.</p><p>As a business partnership, the Two of Cups is a sign that you are both on the same wavelength and share a similar vision for the business you are creating together. You may not have the same skills as each other, but you create a beautiful synergy when you work together. For example, one of you may be talented at sales and marketing while the other is talented at managing the operations of the business. A partnership like this – built on trust, harmony, and mutual respect – is likely to succeed so long as you continue to communicate with one another and focus on your alignment together. (Though, it never hurts to also have a contract or agreement in place to ensure this dreamy business partnership continues this way.)</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>At its core, the reversed Two of Cups is about self-love. Love, in any form, starts with love for yourself. When you love yourself unconditionally, you fully accept and appreciate who you are, and you deeply respect and honor the truest version of yourself. You welcome a life of happiness and fundamentally believe you deserve to feel good about yourself. And when you come from this place of self-love, self-acceptance, and self-respect, you will have more fulfilling, loving relationships with others. It all starts with self-love.</p><p>Here’s the thing: if you don’t love yourself, you’ll end up projecting your lack of love onto others, becoming clingy and attached, attracting the wrong kinds of relationships to you, or worse, ending up in harmful situations. This is the shadow side of the Two of Cups reversed. On the flip side, if you love yourself, you will attract and keep only the most fulfilling relationships that serve your Highest Good and be able to completely give and receive love without attachment or expectation. So before you seek out your Prince Charming or tie the knot with your lifetime love, make sure you’ve filled your cup with all that beautiful love juice for yourself first. To find fulfillment in your life and relationships, you have to find the love within you and give it to yourself. No other person, material possession, or accomplishment can do it. It’s entirely up to you.</p><p>The Two of Cups reversed can sometimes indicate a break-up or a falling out. You are out of sync with each other and aren’t making the same emotional connection that you did in the past. You may be feeling a lack of trust and being open with one another is proving to be difficult. Communication may also be restricted and withheld and the energy flow between you has been stifled. To turn this situation around, open up, share, and hold a safe space for one another to honestly express your feelings and what you are experiencing. Even with one conversation, you can shift the energy flow dramatically.</p>"

    "id": "threeofcups",
    "img": "images/threeofcups.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Three of Cups is a card of celebration, friendship, sisterhood, and creative collaborations. Your friends and family are here to support you and lift you up to even higher levels of success. Celebrate with them and enjoy their company.</p><p>When the Three of Cups appears in a Tarot reading, you are encouraged to gather with your closest friends and have a good time together, talking, laughing, sharing and creating. Together, you receive the love, support and compassion you need right now from one another. You may be inspired to have a girls’ night out, a weekend away, or start a women’s circle, so that you can join forces with like-minded people and enjoy each other’s company. The energy is high and you're here to do amazing things together.</p><p>This card reminds me of the wonderful connection and friendship that exists between the four female characters in Sex and the City—Carrie, Charlotte, Samantha and Miranda. They stand by each other through thick and thin, and they are always there for one another as they make their way through various relationships, careers and other life journeys. Nearly every episode, they can be found enjoying each other’s company, often over a cosmopolitan or another fancy cocktail. You get the feeling that these girls will be friends forever and will know that they can always count on each other for support and compassion.</p><p>The Three of Cups often indicates a very sociable period – perhaps a birthday, a wedding, the holiday season or a vacation with friends. This is your opportunity to let your hair down and forget about your day-to-day commitments and obligations for a while. Instead, this is all about spending quality time with friends and family and enjoying yourself!</p><p>The Three of Cups is your invitation to collaborate with others on a creative project and inspire one another to reach new heights. Collectively, you are working towards a common goal for the greater good of others, and by reaching out to others and banding together, you can achieve a great deal in terms of sharing your positive energy and passion with others, benefiting the wider community. The Three of Cups is also a very creative card, suggesting that you may pursue a creative outlet within a group environment, such as an art class or a dance class. This is a great way to connect with others and to access your creative abilities.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>While the upright Three of Cups is a card of friendship and social events, the reversal of this card suggests that you would prefer to go it alone right now. You may have recently spent a lot of time with others and now just need some ‘alone time’. Or perhaps you are no longer ‘clicking’ with some of your friends or a particular social group and you’re ready to move on. Or in some cases, you might find yourself on the 'outer', excluded from other people's circles and feeling isolated and alone. Honour your desire to step out of the social scene for a while, and enjoy this time by yourself so you can get clear on who you most want to connect with in the future.</p><p>If you are involved in a creative project, now may be the time to work independently rather than in a group. The reversed Three of Cups can indicate that your creativity is being stifled and instead you are being forced to conform to the group in which you are operating. You may be part of a very tight-knit group that does things a certain way and is not open to innovation or alternative approaches. You need to consider whether you are willing to sacrifice your creative abilities in favour of the group’s desires.</p><p>If you are experiencing high levels of stress or you’ve been working hard, the reversed Three of Cups appears as a message to take some time off to recuperate and gain the support of friends before returning to reality. You may have been working so hard that you’ve lost your connection with your friends and family. Now is the time to reconnect and reprioritise their love and support. See this card as a reminder to reconnect with your friends, let your hair down and have a good time, without worrying too much about the consequences.</p><p>On the other hand, the Three of Cups reversed may indicate overindulgence in the party scene. You may be out most nights partying, doing drugs or drinking heavily. You might be in the ‘work hard, play hard’ mindset, when what you need is greater balance in your life. Be mindful about the longer-term consequences of your actions and ask yourself whether this is indeed a sustainable lifestyle. Take a break from the social scene to regroup and get some much-needed sleep.</p><p>When it comes to relationship readings, the reversed Three of Cups can sometimes appear when there is a third person involved. You may be involved with someone who is already in a relationship with someone else, whether you know it or not. Look to the other cards for more detail on the nature of the relationship. If you see the Seven of Swords, there is likely a betrayal of trust and possible cheating. If you see the Five of Swords, it is likely that you already know about the other relationship, but you are trying to ignore that it exists. If you see the Devil, think carefully about the nature of the relationships as they are likely to be hedonistic and generally unhealthy to those involved. It is unlikely that this situation is sustainable as ‘three’s a crowd,’ and something has to give.</p>"

    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>When the Four of Cups appears in a Tarot reading, new invitations and opportunities are flowing to you, but for now you're saying “no” and turning them away. Perhaps the opportunities do not interest you or your cup is full and you already have too much on your plate. You are using your discernment to decide on what is truly important to you and you are not afraid to decline new projects that are not in alignment with your future path.</p><p>The Four of Cups can also indicate a time when you are now bringing your attention and your energy within, to create a new sense of alignment at this new phase of your life. You know that you need to be fully grounded in who you really are before you can decide your next steps. While you may need to decline some very alluring opportunities, you do so knowing that soon, you will be in a better position to say 'yes' to the opportunities that are a better fit for you. You are creating the space within yourself so that you are ready to accept new opportunities later and give them the best possibility of success. Use this time for inward reflection, grounding, and contemplation so that you are fully aligned before accepting the next 'big thing'.</p><p>Sometimes this card brings the message, “Not now, but maybe later.” While the man in the Four of Cups doesn’t accept the cups offered to him, he doesn’t completely reject them either. You may be waiting for a sign or further information before accepting an invitation or new project. You may also be checking in emotionally and spiritually before saying ‘yes’, to make sure the opportunity is indeed a good fit and that you can commit to it in the long-term.</p><p>The Four of Cups can appear when you are bored or dissatisfied with your everyday life. You may be feeling disengaged, apathetic or unmotivated, and life has become dull. The invitation from the Four of Cups is to bring your attention inward and re-evaluate your situation to find a deeper understanding and meaning to what you do. You may have found yourself disconnected from your emotional self and inner truth, and need to re-establish this connection so you can feel a greater sense of purpose and direction. This may also be a good time to switch off from the distractions of the external world – social media, the news and other people’s stories – to allow you the space to listen to your own voice and inner knowing, and gain more clarity.</p><p>The Four of Cups may also indicate that you have shut yourself off from new opportunities because you have been hurt or rejected before. The man in this card has his arms crossed, as if protecting himself and closing himself off from the external world. You may have been hurt in a relationship or experienced failure in your career, and now want to avoid getting in the same predicament again. However, the cost of doing this is that you may miss out on new opportunities that are actually a great fit for you. Check in on a soul level as to whether shutting yourself down is the best course of action, or if it’s time to open up more to the possibilities that are available to you.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Four of Cups reversed reflects a period of introspection and withdrawal. You are retreating into your own inner world so that you can reflect on what is truly important to you and what grounds you. Others may be wanting to spend time with you or are inviting you out, but you'd much rather stay in and read a good book or meditate in your sacred space. Just be careful that you don’t completely shut off your friends and loved ones or appear disinterested in their lives. Let them know that you simply need some alone time and that you’ll reach out again when you’re ready to re-emerge.</p><p>If you are feeling withdrawn, don't force yourself to go out. Just 'be' in this space, and when you're ready, start to re-integrate with the world around you. You won't be a 'hermit' forever – it's just a temporary state of being for now. Appreciate it and make the most of it.</p><p>You may also be using this time of introspection to go within, so you can check in with your inner being to make sure your upcoming projects and endeavours are a fit for you. Instead of saying ‘yes’ straight away, you’re taking a step back and evaluating the situation first. That said, be careful that you don’t completely lose this opportunity as you wait for an answer from within. Check to see if there is an expiry date or when you need to make a final decision and be sure not to miss it.</p><p>At times the Four of Cups reversed suggests that you are feeling uninspired, disillusioned, or disappointed with the world around you. Everything feels hard and instead of dealing with it head on, you’re choosing to withdraw and go within. You may be avoiding the challenges of the external world hoping that if you step out of it, the problems will go away. But let’s be real – they may still be there when you return and will need your attention eventually.</p><p>The Four of Cups reversed may suggest you are reluctant to open your heart to someone or to express your true feelings, instead choosing to withdraw and isolating yourself from the other person. Be mindful of how this may be impacting those who are close to you and be considerate of their needs as well as your own.</p>"

    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Five of Cups often appears in a Tarot reading when a situation hasn't turned out the way you expected and you feel sad, regretful, and disappointed. Instead of moving on with your life, you are choosing to wallow in your self-pity. All you can focus on right now is what went wrong and how you have failed. Sweetheart, it’s time to build a bridge and get over it! Sure, feel the feels, but set yourself a time limit for your self-pity and then pull yourself together and move on.</p><p>The Five of Cups also suggests you’re stuck in the past and can’t let go. Old wounds and bitter memories are flooding your thoughts, as you think about what happened and where it all went so wrong. You may be blaming yourself or feeling a victim of life’s circumstances. These negative thoughts and emotions are holding you back from your fullest potential and need to be released so that you can move on and create positive change.</p><p>Forgiveness is key with the Five of Cups, both of yourself and others. If you are feeling disappointed by another person’s actions, find it within your heart to forgive that person, releasing yourself from the disappointment. And if you are disappointed with yourself, know that you did the best that you could given the circumstances and you have now learned from your mistakes.</p><p>Remember, too, that hindsight is much clearer than foresight and wisdom in the present moment is gained from the mistakes of the past. Reflect on what led you to this point and understand what important lessons you can take from the experience. Even when things go pear-shaped, there is always something positive that can be gained by reflecting on the lessons learned.</p><p>The Five of Cups is showing you that even though it feels like things aren’t going your way right now, there are new opportunities and possibilities waiting for you – but only when you are ready. It’s time to shift your mindset away from what went wrong, and instead focus on what can go right from this point onwards. Be open to the brighter side of life and know that there are many blessings in disguise right now. Instead of looking at the situation from a ‘glass is half empty’ perspective, look at it as the ‘glass is half full’.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed Five of Cups suggests that you have recently suffered a personal setback or disappointment. You are not quite ready to open up to others about what happened, instead choosing to keep your feelings to yourself. People around you may not realise how much you are hurting right now. To help you through this rough time, don't be afraid to ask for help or talk with someone you trust; you may find it lessens the emotional pain. You may also be worried that you are a 'failure' and you don't want to let others know that you've taken the wrong path. Much of this is in your own mind and you'll find that by sharing your feelings with others, you'll realise that this is just a temporary setback that can be overcome.</p><p>You may also feel guilty or ashamed about what happened, blaming yourself for the mistakes that were made. The invitation of the Five of Cups reversed is to forgive yourself and move on. Know that you did the best you could given the circumstances. This may also be the perfect opportunity for you to practice the Hawaiian forgiveness ritual, Ho’oponopono, where you say sorry, ask for forgiveness, express gratitude and feel into love.</p><p>When this card appears in a Tarot reading, you are beginning to realise the full implications of the past, and you have come to appreciate the lessons learned from the experience. You may even recognise the value of the painful experience in the broader scheme of things in preparing you for later experiences.</p><p>The Five of Cups reversed serves as a reminder that you cannot undo the past – what has happened, has happened. It is now time to finally release and let go what no longer serves you emotionally, and open up to the new opportunities available to you. You are also discovering how to be open and take risks again, especially those of the heart. If you have suffered setbacks recently, you will find that you will feel more hopeful about the future and you will start to engage with the inspiring, creative and feeling side of life again.</p>"

    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Six of Cups is a card that takes you back to the joyful memories from your past, whether as a child, teenager or young adult. You may simply be revisiting those memories in your mind, or you may travel back to your childhood home or reconnect with your childhood friends. You could be going to a high school reunion or reconnecting with a childhood friend. A teenage sweetheart or past lover may turn up again. These connections bring you a sense of joy and happiness as you reminisce on all of the fun times you had together. You will also have the opportunity to explore whether you still have a lot in common and if you wish to continue the relationship now in the present moment.</p><p>The Six of Cups often indicates an increased level of harmony and cooperation in your relationships. You are open to give and receive, without expectation. You are also willing to give each other the benefit of the doubt, having moved on from the challenging emotions of the Five of Cups. It’s time to turn a new leaf and start afresh from a more positive place.</p><p>The Six of Cups invites you to get in touch with your inner child and experience all of the fun, freedom and innocence that comes with being a young child again. You might like to start an adult colouring book, dance like no-one is watching you, play your favourite childhood games or simply spend more time around (happy) children. When you give yourself permission to be playful, spontaneous, and creative, you connect more deeply with your genuine, authentic self and your intuition.</p><p>The Six of Cups can also refer to children in your life. It can suggest a pregnancy (perhaps twins), a birth and siblings who play nicely together. It may also be a sign that you are about to spend more time with young children, playing, laughing and learning together. Children are often here to teach you something about yourself and can serve as great advisors. Kids are also good role models to follow when you wish to be more present, open-minded and curious as they see the world as a magical place and their hearts are open to the myriad of pleasures available to them.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>When the Six of Cups reversed appears in a reading, you may be clinging to the past and losing touch with the present. Reflecting on the past may bring up positive or negative feelings, but either way, when you find yourself living in the past or wishing for 'how things used to be' and not living in the present, you miss out on the opportunities that are here for you now. Indulge a little in reminiscing about the past, but know that it is only in the present moment where you can make true, lasting change. This is also an opportunity for you to make peace with the past so that you can focus on the now. Learn from your mistakes, forgive others and yourself, and acknowledge that life is in a constant state of change as you move from ‘what has been’ to ‘what is’. Let go of the past, and bring your attention firmly into the present.</p><p>The reversed Six of Cups may also be a sign that you have lost touch with your inner child and life has become boring, repetitive, and ‘stale’. You might be closed off to new opportunities and gifts from the Universe, simply because you are taking on too much responsibility and heaviness that’s often associated with being an adult. Now is the perfect time to open yourself up to a curious mind and to have some fun, as if you were a child again. If you find yourself saying, 'Oh but I don't have time!' then make time!! Play! Have some time out. Go jump in puddles or build sand castles.</p><p>At times, the Six of Cups reversed can be a sign that you are taking a walk down memory lane, but privately. Perhaps you are thinking about an ex or you’ve even started seeing each other again, but you are choosing to keep this information private to you. You may be reluctant to let others know that you are going back to your past and revisiting these old memories or relationships, in fear that they may judge you negatively.</p>"

    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Seven of Cups is a card of new opportunities, choices, and at times, illusion. When the Seven of Cups appears in a Tarot reading, you are being presented with many different options and opportunities from which you can choose. But be careful—you are prone to illusion and unrealistic ideals. An opportunity may initially sound appealing with promises of more money, more fame, or more power, but as you look deeper into what is really on offer, you may realise it’s not everything it’s cracked up to be. Your ego may be pulling you in a certain direction, but it’s important you check in with your Higher Self first to make sure it is in true alignment with the greatest good. Evaluate your options and dig below the surface to discover what's really involved with each choice.</p><p>Often, the Seven of Cups can be a sign of wishful thinking and projecting into the future about what you would like to create, rather than taking action here in the present to make it happen. For example, you may be wishing for a fitter, more healthy body and reading all the Womens’ Health magazines, but failing to actually get out there and start exercising and eating better. Or you might wish for a successful business fuelled by passive income, but you’re not ready and willing to put in the hard work now to enjoy the fruits of your labour later. If you find yourself spending most of your time wishing but not actually doing the work, then it’s time to choose just one thing to focus on and make it happen.</p><p>You may also find that your ideas and plans are not grounded in reality. Your ideas might sound fabulous in your imagination, but when it comes to implementing them, you may be leaving yourself open to disappointment when you realise that your vision simply does not work in the real world.</p><p>The Seven of Cups may be a sign of ‘shiny object syndrome’, where you keep finding the ‘next big thing’ but you fail to take action and see any of those new opportunities through to the end. When you are constantly in an idea phase, you miss the chance to bring your ideas into fruition and make them a reality. Again, this is a time to focus on the one thing that will move you closer to your goal, and resist the temptation to get side-tracked with other ideas as they arise. If need be, note down your ideas as they come up, but stay focused on the one thing you’re taking action on.</p><p>This card is inviting you to move out of the ideas and options phase and make a choice. Each option will have its pros and cons – it’s up to you to check in with yourself and make sure that the option you do choose is in alignment with your purpose and your Highest Good. A choice needs to be made now, too, even if you feel somewhat paralysed by all of the options available to you.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed Seven of Cups often appears when you are faced with a number of different options, but before making your final choice, you are getting clear about your personal values and what’s really important to you. Instead of choosing the option that may appeal to others, you are relying on your inner wisdom and guidance system to show you the option that is the best fit for you. You may also be coming up with your own criteria to help you make decisions that are in alignment with your inner being.</p><p>If you find yourself with multiple opportunities or ideas, ground yourself first and reflect on what you really want for the long-term. All these shiny new objects in front of you have a certain 'magic' power over you right now and you're at risk of losing focus if you chase after pipedreams or opportunities that almost seem too good to be true. Take a step back and assess the options against your priorities to work out which ones will be truly of benefit to you.</p><p>As a card of choices and options, the reversed Seven of Cups can indicate the you are overwhelmed by choice and are unable to move forward. Reduce your options and focus on what is truly important to you. You don’t need to keep searching for that big idea – you already have what you need and you simply need to make a choice and move forward with it.</p>"

    "img": "images/eightofcups.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>When the Eight of Cups appears in a Tarot reading, you may feel compelled to walk away from a disappointing situation or relationship. You may be turning your back on an unfulfilling relationship, job, career, living arrangement or creative project that was once a source of great happiness to you but now only brings you pain. This is a situation where you have previously invested yourself emotionally, but despite your best efforts, you are left feeling disappointed, and disillusioned because it hasn’t turned out the way you had expected it to. You have come to realise that you are no longer getting anything out of this situation and it is causing more harm than good. Now, the only option is to put it behind you and move on with your life, even if it brings you sadness as you say good-bye.</p><p>Similarly, the Eight of Cups appears when you feel like there is something missing, particularly on an emotional or spiritual level, and instead of waiting around for things to get better, you know you need to leave that unfulfilling situation. It may not make sense to others because on the face of it, it appears as if you have everything you had wished for. However, deep down, you know it’s not serving your Highest Good and it’s time for you to let it go and move on.</p><p>At times, the Eight of Cups is a sign that you are trying to escape a difficult emotional situation or you are avoiding some major emotional issues and concerns. The Cups in the foreground represent emotional issues that remain very real and very present in your life. Yet you are trying to pretend as if they no longer exist and you are refusing to deal with them. You may be repressing your emotions or refusing to have open conversations with others about what’s really going on, instead preferring to pretend as if everything is okay, or avoiding the situation altogether.</p><p>The Eight of Cups invites you to ask yourself what truly brings you joy, contentment and fulfillment on a deeper level. This is important because without it, you may find yourself pursuing goals that fail to provide you the satisfaction you’re seeking. For example, you may think that being in a long-term relationship is what you desire, but when you manifest it, you realise that it’s not just the long-term relationship that you want but also a deep soul connection with someone and if that’s not there, then the relationship isn’t going to fulfill your needs no matter how long-term it is. So, if you find yourself repeatedly in these Eight of Cups situations where you have no choice but to walk away, spend some time exploring what’s going to bring you true happiness and realign your goals with your values.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed Eight of Cups raises the question, “Do I stay or do I go?” You may be caught between walking away from a disappointing situation or trying one last time to make things better. But the real question is, “Can the circumstances really improve, or is it a lost cause?” Check in with your intuition and your Higher Self to understand whether it is in your best interest to give this situation one more chance, or if you are desperately clinging on when really, it is time to release and let go.</p><p>If the reversed Eight of Cups is paired with more passive cards such as the Hanged Man or the Four of Swords, then it may be a sign that you wish to try one more time. However, if this card is paired with a more active card such as the Eight of Wands or Chariot, it may be time to move on and pursue a different path.</p><p>The invitation with the reversed Eight of Cups is to listen deeply to your heart about your next course of action. Others may have an opinion, but ultimately it comes down to what’s important to you. Only you know whether this situation is serving you and if there is hope for the future. Be consciously aware of what you truly desire and then check in to see if this situation is in alignment with your goals and dreams.</p><p>At times, the reversed Eight of Cups can indicate that you are aimlessly drifting from one place to the next because you never feel satisfied with staying in the one place. “The grass is always greener on the other side.” If this resonates, ask yourself what truly makes you happy and how you can create your life in a way that is in alignment with your deepest contentment.</p>"

    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>You know those moments when you look around you and feel your heart over-flowing with love and appreciation for everything you have created in your life? That’s what the Nine of Cups is about – emotional fulfillment, happiness and contentment. When this card appears in a Tarot reading, you feel deeply satisfied in all aspects of your life – relationships, work, lifestyle, well-being and more. You are basking in the abundance of life and experiencing your emotions with such intensity and pleasure.</p><p>This is why the Nine of Cups is often called the wish card. It comes as a sign that the planets have aligned and you have everything you wished for. You could not be happier! If you have made your wish and are patiently waiting for it to come to fruition, then this card is a very good omen that you wish will soon be granted.</p><p>The Nine of Cups is also an invitation to splurge, indulge and enjoy life’s pleasures. This includes enjoying good food and wine, appreciating the arts, making love, relaxing in a beautiful resort or experiencing beauty. Live in the moment, and give yourself permission to indulge temporarily without feel guilty about the possible negative consequences of such enjoyment.</p><p>When you see the Nine of Cups in a reading, remember to count your blessings and express gratitude for what you have created. Start or end every day by creating a mental list of the three things you are most grateful for. Over time, you will intensify your feeling of contentment and your ability to attract what you wish for – it is the Law of Attraction. If you are struggling to find the positive side of life, then expressing gratitude will help you to see what you already have created and that you indeed have a lot to be happy about.</p><p>One thing to keep in mind with the Nine of Cups is that he is sitting on a wooden bench, which is comfortable for only a limited period of time. Be aware that contentment and fulfillment, too, are only temporary as everything is always in a state of change. That’s why it is so important to appreciate what you have now and cherish it, because it may be gone later or you may need to adjust and adapt in the future.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>Even when it appears you have everything you could have ever dreamed of, it can still feel like there is something missing deep down. You may be pursuing material gain, at the expense of your spiritual growth or emotional fulfilment. For example, you might have the most expensive home or car on the block, but if it means you need to work 80 hours a week and never see your friends and family, you’re going to feel pretty miserable. This is the essence of the reversed Nine of Cups and when it appears in a Tarot reading, it is asking you to reconsider what it is you wish for and align it with your Highest Good. You may have lost touch with what’s truly important to you, instead favouring the ego and what will impress others.</p><p>The reversed Nine of Cups is a sign that instead of looking outside of yourself for your happiness, look within. Success and happiness mean different things to different people. So, instead of doing what you think will make other people happy, do what will make you happy. Ask yourself, “What does success look like to me? And how will I know when I am successful?” If your outside world is not bringing contentment, change your definition of success.</p><p>Sometimes, the reversed Nine of Cups suggests that you are disappointed and frustrated that your wishes have not yet come true. Your expectations may be unrealistic, or you may not be actively pursuing your dreams, instead hoping that they will manifest with little input or action from you. You may have also chosen goals that are not deeply fulfilling to you and so you have let them fall by the wayside. Now is the time to reconnect with your goals and dreams, and recommit to bringing them to fruition. You may need to tweak your goals so that they are in full alignment with your personal values. And you may need to be more proactive in creating an action plan to see your goals come to fruition.</p><p>The Nine of Cups reversed also serves as a reminder not to over-indulge at the expense of your health and well-being. You may be prone to overdoing it when it comes to food, alcohol, drugs, partying or spending. Keep everything in moderation and focus on the long-term consequences of your actions, even if they bring short-term pleasure.</p>"

    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Ten of Cups embodies happiness, joy, contentment and emotional fulfillment, particularly in the area of relationships and family. You have created an abundance of love and happiness in your life and you now share this love with others, expanding your heart even more. This card often appears when you are surrounded by your loved ones with whom you share a very strong and deep connection. You appreciate and support one another, and together, you help each other fulfill your highest potential. It brings you so much joy to see your loved ones succeed and live happy lives.</p><p>The Ten of Cups is the ‘happy family’ card, suggesting that your family relationships are harmonious and loving right now. No one is fighting or causing any tension; all family members are getting along with each other and sharing in the love and happiness that surrounds you. This card may appear in a reading when you are spending more time with family, perhaps on a family holiday, reunion or event, where you can rest and relax together, creating fun and happy family memories and strong bonds.</p><p>The Ten of Cups is also a very positive card in terms of romantic relationships and may indicate either the beginning of a new and blissful relationship or a long-term commitment, such as engagement, marriage or starting a family together. You share an everlasting love and may feel that you are soul mates destined to be with one another. When the Ten of Cups appears in a Tarot reading, you feel a sense of wholeness, completion, and alignment in your relationships with others. You are experiencing an idyllic state of peace, harmony and love where all your dreams and wishes have come true, and you are celebrating everything you have created. Take a moment to step back and truly appreciate everything that you have accomplished. You have created a life of connection and bliss by following your heart and trusting your intuition.</p><p>The Ten of Cups encourages you to follow your heart and trust your intuition to lead you to those opportunities that are in your Highest Good. Your feelings and emotions will guide you. When something feels really good and in alignment with your Highest Self, do more of it; and when something doesn’t feel good, do less of it. Allow your inner guidance system to lead the way. Seek out opportunities that make you feel fulfilled and that are aligned with your personal values, rather than simply following the path that others expect you to take.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>When the reversed Ten of Cups card appears in a Tarot reading, you are seeking greater harmony and connection in your relationships. In your mind, you had wished for a beautiful, harmonious relationship, but in reality, you feel disconnected and disengaged from your loved one. It may feel as if there is something missing, and you’re struggling to truly communicate, empathise, and engage with one another. Each time you try to connect, something goes wrong and you end up feeling even more distance between you. You may have unrealistic expectations of the relationship; that everything is going to be perfect and rosy every minute you are together. If this resonates, then realign your expectations and realise that every relationship has its ups and downs. Or, you may no longer be a fit for each other, in which case you may be considering leaving the relationship.</p><p>The invitation of the Ten of Cups is to seek out common ground with your loved ones, and rebuild the relationship from there. See the other person as a Divine Being who is worthy of your love; and equally, see yourself as a Divine Being who is worthy of their love. Love and be loved. Open up the lines of communication and be ready to hold space for one another so that you can reconnect on a deeper, more loving level. Be compassionate, understanding, and respectful, and seek out harmony with one another.</p><p>The reversed Ten of Cups can also appear when you are contemplating what a loving relationship means for you. Rather than actively building relationships with others, you are focusing your attention inward, so you can gain clarity around what you want from a relationship. Ask yourself what an ideal relationship looks like to you and how you want to give and receive love. Consider how you can bring more of this energy into your future relationships. You may also look at your existing relationships and check in to see how these relationships align with your desires. Let go of any relationships that no longer bring you fulfillment and happiness, and welcome in new relationships that are in alignment with your Highest Good.</p><p>Similarly, the Ten of Cups reversed can indicate a misalignment of personal values. You are not living by your personal values, and you are not being true to yourself. You are allowing others to determine what will and will not make you happy rather than looking within for that source of fulfillment. As a result, you are questioning whether you believe in what you are doing. Bring your focus back to what truly makes you happy, even if it is different to what others think will make you happy.</p><p>Finally, the reversed Ten of Cups may also suggest that you are neglecting your family while you pursue more material goals such as progressing your career or making more money. Your work-life balance is out of whack, and you are spending less and less quality time with your family. If you continue to neglect your family, you will find that relationships will suffer and you may not be able to achieve an overall sense of contentment and happiness as planned.</p>"

    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Page of Cups suggests a new creative idea or opportunity has come to you out of the blue. Creative energy is flowing through you and it is now up to you to choose how that creative energy will be expressed. Will you snap up this new creative idea and turn it into something, or will you simply let it go and let someone else bring it to fruition? It is up to you! Spend some time exploring the idea to see if it is indeed for you to take forward.</p><p>The Page of Cups invites you to have an open and curious mind. Be open to anything – including a fish randomly popping its head out of a cup! It is with a curious mind that you will discover new aspects of life and yourself. Open your mind to all possibilities, especially those of a creative, intuitive or emotional nature, you will be pleasantly surprised. Be ready to dream the impossible dream, and explore the magic of your fullest potential, even if it feels out of reach. The Page of Cups is asking you to embrace your inner child and believe that anything is possible.</p><p>As each Page asks you to explore a new aspect of yourself, the Page of Cups is asking you to explore your creative, intuitive and emotional self. You may start a new art class, read books about how to express your feelings authentically, or learn more about developing your psychic abilities. You are filled with dreamy aspirations about what is possible. You may also be more likely to express your emotions and be moved by simple things. Don’t be afraid to let your feelings show and wear your heart on your sleeve.</p><p>This card often appears when you are being called to trust your intuition and be open to the multitude of intuitive messages that are being given to you right now. Look for synchronicities and signs from nature that will guide you on your path. They may come from unexpected places or they may not even make sense to your rational mind; simply be open to the possibility and ready to discover new aspects of yourself. It is like following ‘intuitive breadcrumbs’ – one intuitive clue leads you to the next thing, and the next, and the next. And before you know it, you have found yourself in a place of full alignment, happiness and bliss. All by trusting your intuition and going with the flow.</p><p>In a practical sense, the Page of Cups can indicate that you will receive an unexpected and pleasant surprise. The Pages are often known as the messenger cards, and in the case of the Page of Cups, you may receive a message related to the emotions, intuition, or creative endeavours. It might be the birth of a baby, an engagement or marriage, a new love interest, or the offer of a new creative project. It is not a surprise that you can anticipate or force; simply be ready to receive when the moment comes.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed Page of Cups suggests that you are keeping your creative inspirations and ideas secret. You may be anxious that others will steal your idea or that they will tell you it’s an impossible pipedream and why it’s destined to fail. Instead, you are choosing to keep your ideas privately so that you can develop the idea further without the influence of others. You may want to wait until the idea has turned into action before sharing it with others.</p><p>With the Page of Cups reversed, you may feel called to pursue a new creative project but you are worried about whether you can realistically make it work. Your inner critic may be on over-drive or others are telling you that you’re dreaming, so you are stalling and holding back. Ask yourself, “What have I got to lose here?” So what if the idea fails? Isn’t it better to try something and fail than never do it and wonder for the rest of your life what might have happened? And what if you didn’t fail – what if you were to succeed? Again, listen deeply to your intuition to understand if this is just fear getting in the way and whether it’s time to just give it a go regardless of the outcome.</p><p>It is possible that you may be experiencing a creative block when the reversed Page of Cups appears in a reading. There is an aspect of your Self that wants to be expressed, but for whatever reason, you are holding back. You may worry about whether your creativity will lead you in the direction you want, or whether it truly has value in this world. Or, you may feel ‘stuck’ when it comes to actually expressing yourself creatively and you don’t know how to bring this aspect of yourself out into the external environment. The ideas are there but you are having trouble figuring out how to make them into reality.</p><p>If you are starting to explore your intuition, the reversed Page of Cups can suggest that you are experiencing a lot of doubt when it comes to trusting your intuitive feelings. You are trying hard to listen to your intuition, but when the messages come through, you are left wondering if it’s really your inner guidance or if it’s your ego. Open yourself up to the possibility that it is your intuition coming through loud and clear and see where it takes you.</p><p>At times, the reversed Page of Cups can indicate someone who is emotionally immature. Perhaps this is someone who is highly emotional and dramatic, who over-shares and takes the concept of vulnerability a little too far. This may be someone who is prone to emotional tantrums when they do not get their way. Or it may be someone who is overly dreamy about their future and who is not grounded in reality. Some call it the “Peter Pan Syndrome” where an adult does not want to grow up and instead remains a child for the rest of their lives.</p>"

    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Knight of Cups is the classic romantic of the Tarot deck. He is in touch with his intuition and emotions, and he uses them masterfully to charm and attract others. He shows compassion and understanding towards others because he has learned to understand his own feelings and emotions. He is kind, caring and very in touch with his feminine side. He can be found writing a romantic poem to his lover, creating art inspired by his innermost feelings or appreciating a beautiful sunset with a glass of French champagne in his hand. His heart is wide open and he wears his heart on his sleeve. He shares his love freely with others, without constraint or worry; he is in love with love itself.</p><p>When the Knight of Cups appears in a Tarot reading, you thrive on all things beautiful and are inspired by the many creative outlets that are available to you. Whereas the Page of Cups was simply inspired by an imaginative idea, the Knight of Cups is now inspired by action. You have dreamed about what it is you want to create and now are moving forward with this dream and make it a reality. It may be a creative project or something that you feel ‘called’ to do, based on your emotions, imagination and intuition. Be open to exploring your passions and your big ideas at this time. You may find that you have been drawn to a particular passion or hobby and now is the time to start turning it into ‘something.’ While you are in no hurry to reach the finish line, keep in mind that true imagination feeds on action; if you do nothing with your dreams they will remain just that – dreams and not reality.</p><p>Similarly, all Knights are on a mission, and this Knight’s mission is associated with humanitarianism, romance, altruism, compassion, and beauty. You have a vision of harmony and you are ready to bring this vision into reality. You are lead by your heart and want to see peace for all involved.</p><p>When it comes to making decisions, the Knight of Cups is ruled by his emotions and his heart. When this card appears in a Tarot reading, you are making decisions based on what you feel about a situation rather than what you think. You are taking action based on whether it feels good or not, even if others can’t make sense of what you are doing and why. And you are guided by your intuition in everything that you do.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>When the reversed Knight of Cups appears in a Tarot reading, a creative project is emerging but you are not ready to take action just yet. You may be spending most of your time dreaming up what is possible or how wonderful it will be when it comes to fruition. However, you are not yet implementing your ideas. While it can be enriching to be in the dreamy, ideas phase for a while, the idea will not come into being until you start to take action. You may also need to ground your ideas into reality – figure out how much it will cost, how much time it will take, what resources you will need, and so on. This will give your creative project some more weight so that you can start to move forward with the implementation of your idea.</p><p>At times, the reversed Knight of Cups can indicate that you are feeling sulky, moody, and jealous. You are allowing your emotions to get the better of you, especially if you are not getting your way. You may also feel frustrated that you are not being given the opportunity to dream and create, instead needing to stay in ‘the real world’ which can be boring and routine, especially to this Knight.</p><p>The Knight of Cups reversed can describe someone who has an overly romantic approach to life and is disconnected with reality. You may feel some level of disillusionment that an offer is not quite what you expected it to be because you have found yourself caught up in the excitement or emotion of a situation. For example, you might quit your office job so you can work at home, only to realise you miss the social contact with your co-workers. Or you might sell your home to travel the country, only to find that your campervan needs a whole new engine on Day Two of your journey.</p>"

When you see the Queen of Cups in a Tarot reading, you are embodying the ‘nurturing mother’ energy. You support others by listening with your heart, being compassionate, and caring for them deeply. You are empathic and can sense the needs of others easily by tuning in to your intuition. And you hold the space for others to express their emotions and be their truest, most authentic versions of themselves. You have mastered this in such a way that, even though you hold space for emotional expression, you don’t take on other people’s energy or emotional issues because you are well-grounded emotionally yourself and know where to create a healthy separation.</p><p>The Queen of Cups suggests that you are highly intuitive, creative, and in flow with the energies around you. In your interactions with others, you can easily read other people and get a sense of how to communicate effectively so that you both feel heard and understood. Others may come to you to confide in you or talk about their personal issues relating to relationships, emotions and feelings, because they trust you and know that you always have the right solution. You can easily tune in to what others are feeling and can help them make sense of it in a sensitive and compassionate manner. You may be a healer, counsellor or intuitive coach; or maybe just a very good friend. You see the Divine in everyone you meet.</p><p>In your creative projects and endeavors, you ‘feel’ your way into them, trusting your heart and your inner guidance system to lead you in the right direction. You know when something feels ‘off’ and you pay attention to this, even if it doesn’t make rational sense. You may also be in tune with the cycles of the moon and nature in general, using these cycles to manifest your goals and live your dreams.</p><p>When the Queen of Cups appears in a Tarot reading, you are being asked to trust your intuition and pay attention to your feelings and emotions. Lead with your heart, and not your head. Be open to receive the intuitive messages that are flowing to you, be it through your dreams, meditation or visualization. And ‘feel the feels’, even if those feelings are initially difficult or challenging to deal with; you are stronger than you realise.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>When the reversed Queen of Cups appears in a Tarot reading, you need to bring your attention inwards and focus on your emotional well-being. You're great at taking care of others – but now it's time to take care of YOU. This card suggests that you are emotionally drained because you have been so busy supporting others, but not yourself. You may need to set some clear boundaries with your loved ones, so that they know you love them but you are not here to take on their emotional baggage. You can hold space for them, but ultimately, they are responsible for their feelings and life experience, and they need to go on their own journey to learn how to cope effectively.</p><p>The reversed Queen of Cups can suggest that you are wrapped up in other people’s emotional responses and have created a co-dependent relationship that is not healthy for either party. You may be giving too much of yourself away, with little in return. Or you may be inadvertently creating dependency so that you feel needed. Examine your relationships and see where you can create a healthy detachment, where you can still provide emotional support but not to the detriment of one another.</p><p>The Queen of Cups reversed is often a sign that your intuition is on over-drive right now, but to truly hear your intuition, you need to give yourself the time and the space to listen. It doesn’t matter how busy you think you are – this is your sign to reconnect with your intuition and tune in to your inner voice.</p><p>At times the reversed Queen of Cups can suggest that you are letting your heart rule over your head and your emotions may be overwhelming you. If this resonates, it is important to ground yourself, express your emotions privately or with a trusted therapist, and then work through why you’re feeling what you’re feeling. Be careful not to let your emotions over-take your life in such a way that you feel like you are losing control and perspective. Take some quiet time for yourself and meditate or write in your journal. Find a peaceful space to center and calm your soul. Listen carefully to your intuition and your inner voice.</p><p>On the flipside, the Queen of Cups reversed suggests that you may be feeling out of touch with your emotions or that you are forced to restrict how you are feeling deep inside. You may be struggling to express yourself effectively, instead bottling up your feelings internally. If you do not address these emotional issues, they will eventually reach boiling point. Your stress levels may increase, and your ability to cope with everyday issues could suffer.</p><p>The reversed Queen of Cups invites you to explore your innermost feelings and emotions to understand what truly makes you tick. Spend some time alone with just your Tarot cards, your journal and your pen. Connect in with your emotions. How are you feeling? How are you really feeling? It doesn't matter whether you're experiencing positive or negative emotions. You are being called to simply listen to your true feelings and honour them in the process.</p>"

    "img": "images/kingofcups.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The King of Cups represents mastery over the realms of emotion, creativity and the unconscious. When this card appears in a Tarot reading, you have gained control of your emotions and have the maturity to feel your feelings, without allowing them to get the better of you. Even when life throws you a curve-ball, you are able to draw on your emotional maturity and stability to help you navigate these challenges. You don’t let things get to you and you steer clear of the drama, instead choosing an emotionally balanced and calm approach.</p><p>If you are being challenged personally, the King of Cups suggests you need to remain emotionally mature in dealing with the negative energy from others. You need to be clear about your personal boundaries, particularly when it comes to what is and is not acceptable on an emotional level. This King is level-headed and in control of his emotions. He uses his emotional intellect to make smart decisions and does not let other circumstances or whims sway him from his central belief system and his morals. Stay true to your emotions and feelings and do not let others steer you off course.</p><p>The King of Cups embodies the perfect balance between the head and the heart. Not only are you able to assess and manage a situation logically, you are also able to feel into it, drawing upon your intuition and deeper understanding of human interactions. As a leader, you care as much about achieving your goals and objectives as you do about making sure everyone is happy and engaged along the way. If you feel that the head and the heart are out of balance, draw on the energy of this King to realign yourself.</p><p>You are also the master of your inner and outer worlds. You understand and appreciate the power of the subconscious mind and you know how to use it to reach your fullest potential. You are connected with your unconscious mind in such a way that it no longer controls you, but you control it.</p><p>You have a deep understanding of your emotional and spiritual self and at the same time, you are highly aware of how others are responding and behaving and why. You are in tune with the world around you and you know how to while also understanding how others what makes you who you are, and how you can best interact with the world around you.</p><p>The King of Cups is kind and compassionate towards others, creating strong bonds and relationships based on patience and understanding. As you deal with others, you may need to navigate their strong feelings and identify any emotional triggers so that you can create a sense of calm and peace in your interactions. As a King, he has a masculine, fatherly energy, and as a Cups card, he brings his emotional self to the forefront. He offers wise advice when it comes to feelings, emotions, creativity and relationships and is able to see the human dynamic in its entirety. He may appear in your life as a mentor, coach or spiritual guide; or you may step into this role yourself.</p><p>The King of Cups is highly diplomatic and politically correct. He is talented at balancing the needs of many people and keeps everyone working together harmoniously and productively. He knows how to show care and sensitivity as he leads others towards a common goal. He responds carefully to others’ emotional needs and can diffuse a tense situation by reading and responding to the different people involved.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed King of Cups indicates that you are focusing your attention on your innermost feelings and emotions, with the intention of increasing your self-awareness and self-compassion. You are learning more about the emotions that are stored in your subconscious mind and how these emotions affect you on a daily basis. Through the process, you hope to gain a stronger sense of control over your emotional well-being so that your emotions don’t overwhelm you or steer you away from living your best life. You may be reading more self-help books, journaling or seeking the support of a trained counsellor or hypnotherapist so that you can journey deep into your subconscious mind.</p><p>When the reversed King of Cups appears in a Tarot reading, you may be more prone to emotional upset and drama. Others may trigger you or push your buttons, to the point that you feel like you want to completely lose it and throw an emotional tantrum. You may feel moody, depressed, anxious and emotionally unpredictable. You may also lack in self-compassion, beating yourself up about small things that have seemingly gone wrong. If this resonates, seek to understand the root cause of your emotions and bring your conscious awareness to the impact that they are having on your life. Pay attention to your emotional balance and find your place of calm and compassion. Other people may be triggering these emotional responses in you, but it's up to you to stay emotionally in control!</p><p>On the flipside, the reversed King of Cups may indicate that you are repressing your emotions and withdrawing from the outside world because you fear what may happen if you were to deal with your emotions head on. Your feelings are bottling up inside of you and you are at risk of an emotional outburst if the pressure gets too much. If this resonates, you may want to seek the support of a therapist who can help you to work through your feelings in a safe environment.</p><p>At worse, the reversed King of Cups can represent someone who is vindictive and vengeful and has a talent for being able to punish others through emotional manipulation. He uses emotional blackmail to get his way and to push his personal agenda. He leaves you feeling uncertain about yourself and as if you are the problem, not him. This only leads to emotional instability within you, which is entirely undeserved. If this sounds like someone you have met in the past, there is still some work to be done in releasing yourself from his controlling forces.</p>"

    "name": "Ace of Swords",
    "id": "aceofswords",
    "img": "images/aceofswords.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Ace of Swords shows the beginning of a situation whose potential is as double-edged as the blade of the sword itself. The Ace implies the use of great power, even excessive power at times, to further one’s ends but what is not clear is how those powers will be used, or what it is that you are trying to achieve. No matter what the goal, there is always great power behind the attempts to reach it and, as such, very little can stand in the way of the energy of the Ace of Swords without being destroyed.</p><p>The power of the Ace of Swords can be drawn up by anyone whose heart, mind and will are strong. However, it is up to the bearer of the Sword to tap that potential and use it in a way that is beneficial for the greater good.</p><p>The Ace of Swords represents a period of great insight and mental clarity. It signifies a ‘break-through’ or an ‘aha’ moment where suddenly conscious understanding and mental reasoning reach their peak, and achievement of goals suddenly becomes a lot easier. You have a new understanding of some issue that has been of concern, or, in a broader sense, a new world view. This is a perfect time to clear away the fog that has kept you from seeing the inner truth, so that you can now cut to the heart of the matter. This is also a good time to act, and if you set your mind to accomplishing your goals, you can achieve anything you desire.</p><p>The Ace of Swords highlights a new idea, inspiration, original thinking and creative vision. It represents a point at which you have a new way of thinking and the energy to go with it. You are excited to pursue new opportunities that draw upon your creative and mental abilities.</p><p>The Ace of Swords also encourages you to seek out the truth of the matter and to find justice. You may be championing a cause or standing up for your rights or the rights of others. Thus sometimes, the Ace of Swords can suggest that you are prepared for ‘battle’. You have great clarity on a situation and can now argue your case with the view to come out victorious. You may have a new idea for which you are ready to fight, or you may be all fired up on an issue that you are particularly passionate about, such as human rights, the environment or your personal beliefs. This card invites you to use mental force and to use your intellect and critical reasoning. If faced with a challenging situation, you need to be ready for ‘battle’ and be prepared to find the strength to overcome these challenges.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed Ace of Swords suggests that you lack clarity around what your true goals and aspirations are. You have a high-level understanding but have you been able to define this in more specific terms? This card often appears when there is a lack of clarity or complete understanding of the task at hand, and asks you to spend some more time on clearly defining in very real terms what it is you want in life. Set yourself some SMART goals (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound) so you can be really clear on what you are working towards. Focus on the basics and do some better planning.</p><p>The Ace of Swords reversed also reflects an idea or concept which you have not yet put into action, perhaps because you are unsure about whether or not it will bring the results you want. You are having difficulty with the early stages of formulating an idea, a plan or your goals. You may have too many ideas on the go and are unable to make a decision, creating challenges with completion.</p><p>The Ace of Swords reversed identifies clouded judgement and lack of mental clarity around a specific situation. You are missing important information or evidence that will assist you in your predicament, so invest your time and energy into seeking out the truth, rather than simply taking things at face value.</p><p>The reversed Ace of Swords can also suggest that a situation has regressed into to a state of complete chaos and confusion. Whatever clarity you had about the specific situation is now gone, and instead it feels like there is just one big mess.</p>"

    "name": "Two of Swords",
    "id": "twoofswords",
    "img": "images/twoofswords.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Two of Swords is a card of choice and of the difficulty of making a decision. The woman in this card is blindfolded, and this may be intentionally so, indicating that she is avoiding making a very difficult decision. Her state of calm and relaxation may be indicative that she is trying to avoid this important decision in order to bring about peace of mind. However, the decision must still be made. Therefore, the appearance of the Two of Swords indicates that you are currently being faced with a difficult decision but you are attempting to hide from it and pretending to yourself and others that if you ignore the decision long enough, it will go away of its own accord. However, the decision will not go away simply by your willing it to depart. Your conscience will eventually force you into facing your refusal to deal directly with the situation.</p><p>The Two of Swords therefore serves as a reminder that life’s decisions are frequently quite difficult and raise the possibility of painful consequences. However, you must “take the bull by the horns” and make your decisions with your best intentions, fully aware of the possible consequences. Avoidance will ultimately lead to a greater conflict.</p><p>The blindfolded woman in this card is also an indication that you lack the information you need to make the right decisions at this time. You may be missing something, such as threats or potential risks, alternative solutions, or key pieces of information. Once you are able to remove your blindfold and see the situation for what it really is, you will be in a much better position to determine your path forward. Research your options more widely, seek outside opinions and feedback, and ask yourself what you are missing here. Why is this decision so challenging to make? What extra information do you need?</p><p>Given the two swords in this card are in perfect balance as they cross the front of the woman, this card reflects the need for greater balance in your intellectual life. You need to take a break from your usual way of thinking, so that you can begin to consider alternative ideas and viewpoints. You also need to be very diplomatic and weigh up the pros and cons of both options that are available to you, and to consider that there may indeed be another way around the problem. You need to compromise or let things stand as they are.</p><p>The Two of Swords often represents a stalemate where there is no winner or loser. You may be at loggerheads with another person and failing to see each other’s points of view. What is needed is a truce, where you either ‘agree to disagree’ or you seek to understand each other’s points of view before coming to a final solution. Thus, not only does this card represent potential conflict through a stalemate, it also represents making peace through a truce.</p><p>Similarly, the Two of Swords can reflect indecision and being at an impasse with regards to an important matter. Again, there is only so much that you can try to put off. At some point or another, you are going to have to make a decision or have a point of view in order to get things moving again.</p><p>In a reading, it may be helpful to draw a further two cards, either side of the Two of Swords. This will highlight what it is you are trying to balance or decide upon. This may also identify the two alternative solutions from which you are trying to choose.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Two of Swords reversed shows that you are caught between a rock and a hard place and you are finding it incredibly difficult to make a decision about what to do. You are really struggling to see what the right choice is as either option will lead to negative consequences. Lay out the pros and cons of each option that is available to you and weigh up which option will have the most favourable outcome.</p><p>The reversed Two of Swords may also indicate mental confusion as a result of information overload. You are overwhelmed with other people’s points of view and additional, detailed information about what options are available to you. At the end of the day, you are going to have to make a decision, so sift through the advice and the information that is available to select only the most relevant and helpful.</p><p>The reversed Two of Swords may suggest that you are feeling stuck in the middle of two competing sides. You may be trying to play the peace-maker role but in doing this you are just confusing yourself and creating more tension. For example, you may be trying to bring two conflicting family members together in the hope of a harmonious family environment but instead you are finding yourself being the messenger or the dumping ground for each of their concerns. Decide whether or not you truly do have a role to play and whether you can indeed create peace between the two opposing parties. Otherwise, get yourself out of there!</p>"

    "name": "Three of Swords",
    "id": "threeofswords",
    "img": "images/threeofswords.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Three of Swords represents rejection, sadness, loneliness, heartbreak, betrayal, separation and grief. Such events feel so painful because they are unexpected. However, the Three of Swords often serves as a warning sign to show when one or more of these are possible. By preparing for this difficult event, the emotional blow can be minimised or even prevented entirely.</p><p>That said, pain, sorrow and grief are often a necessity in the journey of life. Without pain, there would be no challenge and no lessons learned. Pain can be a great motivator because it encourages you to surmount obstacles and ultimately learn from your mistakes. Each challenge you encounter creates that initial pain, which is inevitably turned into an opportunity to grow stronger and to change the direction of your life as a result of the lessons learned. While the pain may cloud your vision for a certain period, it will eventually allow you to see clearly and to put the past behind you. Though life seems meaningless at the time, recovery can and will occur. It takes faith, self-love, forgiveness and time. Count your blessings.</p><p>The Three of Swords therefore serves as a reminder that if you can start to see pain as a learning opportunity, life will suddenly become less painful. You need to really get in touch with pain and sorrow. Challenges remain but once they are no longer perceived as negative or ‘bad’, they lose a lot of their impact. This card is therefore encouraging you that you have the ability to conquer any pain that comes your way. Understand how the pain can help you grow. If someone has betrayed you and you do not think you can ever love again, challenge that belief. Do not be surprised when your heart emerges from darkness, capable of loving even more than before.</p><p>Similarly, the Three of Swords speaks of loss and difficulty, of sacrifice and broken relationships. It follows the difficult decision required in the Two of Swords, where you may be avoiding the necessity of making a tough choice. In the Three of Swords, the choice has been made, and you are now experiencing the consequences of your action. Often the choices make involve choosing one good over another, or one evil over another, and thus when you have finally made your decision, you are still left with the pain of losing the option you have not chosen. Often, however, the pain of losing something you once valued (such as a ‘comfortable’ relationship in which you are no longer growing) is necessary in order to prepare you for a more fulfilling experience in the future.</p><p>The Three of Swords is also about release. When you have suffered a major setback, or loss, it is a good time to have a good cry, which is all part of the cleansing process. Expressing your sadness and letting it all out will then help you to move on to better times. However, it is also important that you continue to focus on the future path ahead. There can be a risk that you may become overly absorbed in the loss and the surrounding emotions that you lose sight of the need to just let go and move on. The loss becomes your focus rather than the recovery. It is time to accept the loss and then move forward with your life.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>In its reversed position, the Three of Swords indicates that you have recently gone through a difficult patch where perhaps a relationship has ended or has experienced challenging times, a loved one has passed, or you felt hurt from a situation that affected you deeply. Thankfully, this time has passed and you are on the path to recovery, realising that with behind every cloud is a silver lining and there are indeed other things in your life which you can feel happy about. You have reached a point where you can accept the pain and hurt and are ready to move on.</p><p>On the flipside, the reversed Three of Swords can also suggest that you are finding it very hard to move on from a recent loss or heartbreak. This card suggests that inside you are still suffering emotionally from a previous loss and need to go through an emotional purging process to allow yourself freedom from your past. You are doing your best to leave this behind and make a new life but it is still a long journey ahead. Be careful that you are not getting ‘stuck’ in the moment of grief, and instead you are focused on leaving behind your past and embracing new opportunities. It is always hard to bear the pain of separation or understand why you have been inflicted with such sorrow. Learn to accept your situation so that the healing process will not become blocked. Allow yourself to experience the pain, give yourself the right to grieve and release the heartache. Let it go, and then, once the upset, pain and tears have gone, open the door to new experiences.</p><p>If you are experiencing challenges in your relationships, the reversed Three of Swords serves as a reminder to be the peacemaker. Never be afraid to say you are sorry. Always think before you speak so that you will not later regret what you have said.</p><p>When you see the reversed Three of Swords, ask yourself, “In what ways am I suffering? What do I most feel sorrowful about? What can I do to release this pain and learn from it?”</p>"

    "name": "Four of Swords",
    "id": "fourofswords",
    "img": "images/fourofswords.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Four of Swords shows a period of rest and recovery after a time of challenge, with the promise that, once recovered, you can and will return to the challenge. In the meantime, the Four of Swords provides a new challenge – to stay silent and inactive. This is the time build up your mental strength. Meditate and spend time in a calm atmosphere. You need to replenish your strength and spend time in spiritual thinking. You need to rest and relax.</p><p>The Four of Swords is a reminder that after every crisis and before every new challenge, there is always a time of relaxation and contemplation. Constant stress and tension will break even the hardest and most resilient of people but brief periods of rest enable you to refresh your energy, concentration and focus, ready for the next challenge. These rests should be used wisely, to heal the body and ready the mind.</p><p>The Four of Swords is also a sign that you can stop worrying, put down your defences and take a breather from the chaos around you. For the moment there is a truce and you can catch your breath without being attacked again. However, bear in mind that a truce and peace are not the same thing. The Four of Swords is a guarantee that challenges will return to your life as soon as you are ready to face them, so make the most of the stillness and quiet you have earned but never lose sight of the fact that the battle is not yet over, and that there is still work to be done.</p><p>This card suggests that now is the time to rest from some difficult times, perhaps the trauma of breakup or departure, relationship or family problems, financial and health worries, stress and conflict. Take a break. This is also not the time to make decisions, particularly when you are at your most vulnerable.</p><p>The Four of Swords suggests the need for seclusion. You need seclusion to deal properly with your situation and need to experience time apart from others to gather your thoughts and feelings. Following on from the painful loss of the Three of Swords, the Four of Swords indicates your need to spend time alone to re-evaluate your life. Solitude, although often difficult to bear, is necessary for you to be able to recharge your batteries and rejuvenate your spirit. This solitary experience always bears fruit in an experience of greater inner strength and confidence. Retreat from pain, conflict and distractions, and rid yourself of stress and anxiety. Ground and re-charge yourself. Look inward for a real change and meditate daily.</p><p>In a practical sense, the Four of Swords is an indicator that you need to have some time out from your current circumstances, to reflect and review your progress so far. This is a good time to re-evaluate and re-assess your priorities. It is almost like conducting your own “Post Implementation Review” following a major milestone or a major challenge. Create some time and space to reflect on what has worked well, what has not worked well and what you need to change for the future. Pausing for reflection after each major challenge will position you well for success in the future.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Four of Swords reversed can indicate that you are feeling restless and wanting to do everything at once. Even if your body is telling you that you need to rest and relax, your mind may be pushing you forward, trying to accomplish a long list of tasks. You may be getting quite sick or stressed as a result, so it is vital that you force yourself to pause and take it easy to ensure that you do not become completely run down and exhausted.</p><p>You may also be trying to avoid any period of contemplation or meditation on a particular issue because you are worried about what it might bring up. You need to return to the energy of the Three of Swords and confront the pain and grief that exists within your heart. You need to experience that pain as it is preventing you from being able to move on. Once you have experienced it, it will begin to subside and you will be able to live a more fulfilling life.</p><p>The Four of Swords reversed can also represent stagnation and a lack of action that is leading to increased frustration. For example, a long-term marriage is no longer progressing and is spiritually and emotionally empty. You may need to take a break from this stalled situation and come back to it when the energy is flowing better.</p><p>Similarly, the Four of Swords reversed suggests that you are feeling frustrated with the lack of progress and change in your life. Many things have stood still or have failed to change in the way you were hoping they would. Part of this lack of change, however, is as a result of your passive approach. There may have been situations that were frustrating to you or that you were unhappy with but you may have opted to just sit it out and hope that they would eventually change, rather than taking action to create a more desirable outcome.</p>"

    "name": "Five of Swords",
    "id": "fiveofswords",
    "img": "images/fiveofswords.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Five of Swords sees you engaging in conflict or finding yourself disagreeing with others, leading to tension and hostility. Despite thinking you have won, you may still end up the loser because you have hurt or annoyed others and have subsequently isolated yourself. You try to pick up the pieces and act as if the conflict is now in the past but others have now lost faith in you and do not want to be around you. This might be one of those times when it feels like everyone is against you and you may lose some friends along the way. You will need to make a decision about whether your point of view is so important to you that it is ok to put your relationship with others in jeopardy, or whether you can compromise and try to see eye-to-eye with others.</p><p>The Five of Swords can also represent conquest. If you have been aggressive in your struggles, then you will soon accomplish your objectives. However, if you have been passive, you may need to compromise on your personal interests, giving in to the wishes of the opposing force. You will feel that there are more obstacles ahead, and you will not want to face the ordeal you know you must if you are to have what you want or the way you want it. Overall, you are in for a struggle and there is more work or problems ahead than you are aware of now. Things will not go as well as they should, and you will have conflicts or clashes of will with others.</p><p>Thus, the Five of Swords is a card representing ambition but in the negative sense. Too much ambition without regard to the consequences to yourself or others results ultimately in a situation of loss for everyone. You may be represented either by the callous winner or the dejected losers. In any case, there is a negative connotation. If your focus is solely on winning your goals at any cost, you will eventually discover to your own dismay that the price of winning may not have been worth the reward. Arrogance and pride often go hand-in-hand with a difficult triumph such as this, and you must be careful not to think you are invincible. You have overcome a challenge, and you have the right to feel proud but know that there will be other rivals to face and that some of them will eventually defeat you. Boasting to others that you are invincible is an invitation for someone to prove you wrong. If your victory was won through cheating or unethical conduct, beware of an attempt at vengeance.</p><p>The Five of Swords can relate to a betrayal or sneak attack by someone you trust and do not suspect as your enemy. There may be an unfaithful partner or a jealous person in your life who is sabotaging you behind your back. Look to other Court cards in the reading to understand who may be working against you. You must be very careful whom you trust at this point in time because you are vulnerable to attack and gossip.</p><p>The Five of Swords may simply point to defeat. It shows that, despite your best efforts, you are likely to be beaten. If you allow yourself to become disillusioned after such a loss, then you are on the path to increased ruin and torment. Accept your defeat, learn from it, and then make sure that next time you succeed. Be smarter and wiser as a result of your loss. Just as they say in the reality TV show Survivor, “Outwit, Outplay, and Outlast.</p>”<p>Alternatively, the Five of Swords can be seen from quite a different angle – that of a hollow victory. It is possible that the two ‘defeated’ men in this card were really not defeated at all; they simply laid down their arms and walked away. The men either knew that they would lose, or they knew that trying to win would be a waste of energy and a pointless exercise. By choosing not to fight, they are really the winners here, because he who knows when to fight, and when not to fight, will be victorious.</p><p>The advice of the Five of Swords is to pick your battles. You may be tempted to fight every conflict to ensure you get your way, to prove that you are right, or to defend yourself when you are feeling challenged or threatened by another person. However, most experts agree, choosing your battles wisely is a much better way of life than battling out every disagreement. Not only will picking your battles lead to a more peaceful existence, it is also more likely to strengthen your interpersonal relationships.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>As a card of conflict, tension and disagreement, the reversal of the Five of Swords shows that you really just want this period of fighting to be over, so that you can forgive and forget, and then focus your energies on more constructive activities such as restoring your relationship back to normal. The conflict is becoming upsetting now and you realise that there can only be losers in this battle. You now just want to put this behind you and move on.</p><p>Thus, the Five of Swords reversed suggests that you are now more open to change. The arguing is over and you are more willing to look at the situation with fresh eyes. You are willing to lay down your sword and begin negotiating, honestly trying to arrive at a win-win solution rather than always knocking heads. A return to the Four of Swords is required, where tranquillity and peace drive your thoughts and behaviour, moving away from tension and conflict. This is a good time to reach out to those with whom you have recently had conflict or disagreements, and make amends.</p><p>The Five of Swords reversed can sometimes indicate conflict in your life that you have tried to walk away from but which continues to follow you. For example, there may still be an ex in your life who is making things difficult and who may be preventing you from moving on to new relationships. So long as there is conflict, tension and raw emotion at play, avoid this person or situation.</p><p>Similarly, the reversed Five of Swords can suggest that an old wound has been re-opened and you are experiencing fear and tension associated with that memory. You may be particularly worried that history might repeat itself or that you could be hurt again. Aim to forgive and forget so that you can indeed move on.</p><p>There may also be some residual resentment following a recent or past argument with someone close to you. You have had some very challenging and heated conversations together and you still harbour some negative emotion from these discussions. This may still be unresolved and unaddressed and this in itself is impacting your ability to create a harmonious relationship.</p><p>The reversed Five of Swords serves as a reminder that, at times, it may be appropriate to disregard the opinions of others. Sometimes you just cannot please everyone and unfortunately there may be some friendships lost along the way. Sadly, not everyone is going to be as accommodating of your desire to pursue your own goals, particularly if it impacts on them and their ability to live their life the way they want to. What you will have to accept is that you cannot please everyone and there are going to be people who are annoyed that you cannot be there for them as much as in the past. They will just need to deal with this and get over it, I’m afraid.</p>"

    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Six of Swords shows that you will need to make a regretful transition, as a likely result of the decisions you make. You know that in order to move forward, you must leave something important behind, and while you do this with some regret, you know that in the long-term it is the best option for you. There are times when you will be forced to let go of something to which you have been attached, and the process of letting go is often quite challenging. However, the sadness of your loss will soon be replaced by greater clarity, bringing about a renewed acceptance of change. Do not be afraid to let go of whatever it is that is holding you in the present or the past. Instead look to your future and choose the best option that has the greatest long-term potential. There are going to be some hard decisions and some compromises that you will need to make but this is ultimately a ‘rite of passage’ that will take you into a new phase of your life.</p><p>You need to realise that you are now headed towards a much better position in life. You have endured, or are currently enduring, a difficult life transition but as a result, you will be more able to deal with what may come. Do not dwell on the past or what you have left behind. Instead, use this as an opportunity for changing your beliefs about yourself, moving away from whom you used to be and towards whom you really want to be.</p><p>Sometimes the only way to solve life's problems is to leave them behind you and go somewhere new to start over. While it may feel as though you are giving up or being a coward, escape is often the only approach left when all others have failed. The important thing now is that you chart a new course that will lead to greater happiness and joy. The Six of Swords also shows the need to draw upon a state of mental clarity, logic and objectivity in order to examine where you have been and where you are going. This mental clarity will also serve to smooth the way ahead, and make the passage from negative to positive as peaceful as possible. You can use your intuition to guide you through easy situations and call upon your impartial and analytical nature when it is needed for a more complex decision.</p><p>The Six of Swords can also indicate a state of depression or ‘the blues’. You are doing your best to just get through each day as it comes, not particularly enjoying what it has to offer but not really giving up either. You may feel listless, lacking energy and motivation, and somewhat depressed. You are getting by but only just.</p><p>More literally, the Six of Swords can indicate a trip across water (for example, via a ferry, boat, or plane overseas). There may be some sadness in terms of who you will need to leave behind you but you know that this trip will do you a world of good! An example might be someone who is about to travel on their own, leaving behind a partner who they will sorely miss. You may also be required to make a longer-term move from one location to another, where you will leave behind friends and family in order to explore or experience a new territory. Again, while you will miss those you leave behind, you will also find that you have an amazing time on your travels and will learn so much about yourself.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Six of Swords reversed indicates that you are trying your best to move on from the past and make the important transition that you know you need to make. You are trying to physically and mentally move from any past experiences which you know that have not been helping you. However, given this card is reversed, it is clear that you are experiencing some challenges in doing this and no matter how hard you try to leave the past behind you, it keeps catching up with you. It is like there is something pulling you back to where you have come from, rather than allowing you to move on to new territories. What is hard is that there are a lot of unresolved issues from the past, which you had hoped you could just leave behind you but they keep rearing their ugly head and preventing you from getting to that new place of being that you really want to be. There may also be moments when you doubt whether you are making the right decision in leaving behind your past but this card gently encourages you forward, reminding you that you are heading towards a better future.</p><p>Similarly, the reversal of this card may suggest that you are resisting this necessary transition. Perhaps you feel that it has been forced upon you or that you were not included in the decision to move. For example, your partner may be required to relocate for work and you must go along with him/her. What is important is that you look at the benefits of the transition rather than focusing on the drawbacks so that even if this transition is out of your control, you can at least look forward to something and get some sort of personal value out of it.</p><p>In a relationship reading where the relationship is relatively new, the reversed Six of Swords may indicate that you have not moved on from a past relationship and are carrying a lot of ‘baggage’ with you. You need to work hard at leaving this behind you otherwise it will continue to plague your current and future relationships.</p>"

    "name": "Seven of Swords",
    "id": "sevenofswords",
    "img": "images/sevenofswords.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Seven of Swords is a card of deception and betrayal. It indicates the difficulty of trying to ‘get away with something’ undetected and unnoticed. Often when you do something in secret, hoping that you are safe and undiscovered, something goes awry and your secret is revealed to your embarrassment. This card therefore urges caution when attempting to use cunning or deception to gain an advantage over someone or something else. There is no question that there are times in life when it is necessary to act shrewdly or do something in secret. Perhaps you had to think on your feet and act in a way that was not exactly all ‘above board’. Perhaps you had to go behind other people’s backs in order to manifest your desires. Perhaps you felt like you needed to cheat or take the easy way out. If acting shrewdly is something you must do, it is essential that you do this with a clear conscience and you are fully aware of the potential consequences of your actions. Taking the easy path is not always the best path, and sometimes you just have to exert a decent amount of effort to achieve what you want.</p><p>The Seven of Swords indicates that you may be tempted to sneak away from a particular situation that is not working for you any more, rather than dealing with it head on. As you do not feel ready to deal with the issues, you are aiming for a solution where you can just escape and not have to worry about it all. Are you trying to run away from commitment, responsibility, hard work or love? You may be procrastinating, letting problems slip and become worse because you do not want to deal with them. Sometimes you just have to face what has to be faced. So, the question is, “Is this realistic?” Will this ‘escape’ really accomplish what you want to and need to accomplish? Will it address the fundamental issues at hand here? The likely answer is no, and it may simply be an easy way out for now.</p><p>You might think you have gotten away with something but have you? What impact has your actions had on other people? Could someone else suspect something? Is this going to come back to bite you again? Even if you have managed to go undetected, be aware that in the long run, deception will not produce the rewards you desire and may instead cause significant damage to your relationships and reputation. Consider taking a more ethical and morally balanced approach to life from here on.</p><p>On the flipside, the Seven of Swords asks you to be very cautious and wary so that you do not become a victim of someone else’s deception, betrayal, cheating and false motives. You may trust someone who then turns out to be running their own agenda, leaving you high and dry. You need to be very careful of who you trust over these coming months as you are at risk of being taken advantage of. Look out for any sneaky behaviour and trust your gut instinct about when something does not feel right or is too good to be true.</p><p>Sometimes, the Seven of Swords indicates a desire to go it alone. You want to discover, investigate and solve every problem using only your own wits and resources. You may believe that you have a better chance at success if you act on your own accord, ignoring the advice or inputs of others. This approach is useful when you need to bypass an ineffectual group or assert your independence but it can also have its limitations. You may end up feeling isolated and excluded, missing that great feeling of collaboration and synergy gained when you work with others. If you feel inclined to act alone, be sure this isolation will really work for you.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Seven of Swords is a card of mental challenges and rites of passage. The reversal of this card shows that you are finding it difficult to take the first step in a new direction. At times it may seem impossible that you could create the types of changes you want as you continually come up against setback after setback. Yet, you know in your soul, that when the timing is right, you will be able to follow through on your dreams, releasing an old pain from your heart.</p><p>The Seven of Swords reversed suggests that you need to break free from old habits and ways of thinking in order to overcome the blockages that currently stand in your way. You need to accept what is happening to you and act on it, rather than trying to escape. You need to do things differently, releasing yourself from past behaviours or limiting beliefs so that you can move forward in your life. Do not become trapped into thinking that you can only do certain things with which you are familiar. Expand your consideration set to broader horizons.</p><p>If you are involved in an affair or extra-marital relationship, the reversed Seven of Swords shows a growing reluctance to keep up the charade of having this type of relationship. You or your partner may be feeling increasingly uncomfortable with this relationship and would much rather come out in the open about what is happening.</p>"

    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Eight of Swords reflects that you feel trapped by your own thoughts and perspectives. The woman in this card is blindfolded and bound, trapping her into thinking that she has no way out. However, if only she could remove the blindfold and change her thinking, she would see that she does indeed have options. So, the Eight of Swords suggests that you need to look at a difficult situation from a new angle. Draw upon your intellectual self and your emotional self to determine the best path forward, one that avoids any possible victimisation or restriction.</p><p>The Eight of Swords is often a sign that it is best not to make any important decisions at this point because your thinking has been limited and constrained by self-imposed boundaries. You are struggling to see a situation for what it is and have been lead to believe certain things that may or may not be true. There are choices available but first you must be within the right mindset to know which option to choose. This means releasing the bindings and the blindfold to see the situation from a different, less imposing angle. There may also be too many ideas running through your head, thus it is best to wait until you feel more secure and certain about a situation before making important decisions and taking action.</p><p>The woman in the Eight of Swords is often seen as powerless. She has surrendered her power to an unknown entity, thus rendering herself completely powerless. She has become the victim and is now waiting to be rescued. If you see part of this woman in yourself, then it is imperative you take back your power and personal accountability and open your eyes to the options that lie in front of you. The fact is that you do have options, even if you do not like those options. This is fine, so long as you accept that you do indeed have options and you do not have to be the victim here.</p><p>The Eight of Swords portrays a dilemma whereby you are faced with the difficulty of a painful decision and you are at an impasse, uncertain of which way to go. However, what you may not realise is that the decision in the Eight is the result of our own actions. Despite the fact that you have boxed yourself into a corner, there is a way out. The solution is simply to deal with the situation in the most direct yet tactful manner possible, and face your choice with inner strength. It is time to be honest with yourself and others in order to be free of the burden of fear or guilt that is implied with the Eight of Swords.</p><p>The Eight of Swords can indicate that your interests will be opposed by other people, and this may create restrictions to what it is you want to achieve. Take back your power and realise that you have options whether others oppose you or not. You do not have to be constrained by their way of thinking or their rules.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Eight of Swords reversed indicates that you have come through a difficult time and you are becoming more open to change and self-acceptance. You have been able to reflect on what did and did not work in the past and have changed your perspective and approach. You acknowledge that you do indeed have options, and you are refusing to play the role of ‘the victim’, taking greater accountability for where you are in life.</p><p>The Eight of Swords reversed indicates that you need to free yourself from some of the limiting factors of your past. You have some skeletons in the closet that need clearing out. Allow yourself to let go of old patterns of behaviour and belief systems that have previously held you back.</p>"

    "name": "Nine of Swords",
    "id": "nineofswords",
    "img": "images/nineofswords.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Nine of Swords is the card of fear and nightmares, and has an apparently negative ‘feel’ to it. However, the troubles alluded to in the Nine of Swords are primarily of a psychological nature and do not necessarily indicate suffering in your external reality. That is, it is what is inside your mind that is creating the fear and anxiety, not your actual circumstances. Your experience of the world is greatly influenced by our expectations, desires, and fears, and therefore you are largely the creator of your own world, and your attitudes determine how you experience that world.</p><p>The Nine of Swords can also reflect fear of the future, or what may possibly happen in the future. If you allow yourself to be bound by fear of the future, you are at risk of eventually creating a negative reality for yourself by virtue of your expectations. Your nightmare becomes your self-fulfilling prophecy, which is clearly not a desirable outcome.</p><p>Generally, this card is an indication that you are worrying excessively about a situation. You are literally being kept up at night because you are so anxious about a particular issue. It is possible you are working yourself up unnecessarily and, if you were to look at the situation more objectively, you may come to realise that it is not as bad as you are making it out to be. In fact, all that worry and despair is what is making it worse, so rather than fretting about it, do something to change it.</p><p>Although most people experience fear, frustration and uncertainty at some point in their lives, you should not allow those negative emotions to immobilise you or keep you from pursuing your goals with enthusiasm and hope. Expect at least some level of uncertainty in the future, and draw upon your inner strength to remain as flexible and adaptable to that uncertainty as possible.</p><p>The Nine of Swords can also indicate that you are being incredibly hard on yourself, putting yourself down or engaging in negative self-talk. For every mistake you make, you blame yourself and become worked up and angry at yourself for messing up again. So, when the Nine of Swords appears in a reading, ask yourself why you are being so hard on yourself, how are you putting yourself down or what is the source of your depression? What can you do to make yourself feel better? You may need to make a more conscious effort to quit the negative self-talk and replace it with positive reinforcement for a job well done.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Nine of Swords is about worry, anxiety and not being able to sleep because your thoughts are running at one hundred miles an hour. Reversed, the Nine of Swords indicates that you are working yourself up and becoming incredibly stressed and anxious when, really, this does not have to be a complicated issue. You have a tendency to get very worked up about how bad a situation appears, losing sight of what it is really happening and what opportunities are available to you. What is needed here is for you to stop and objectively examine the reality of the situation. Bring yourself back to earth by uncovering your fears and anxieties and working to reduce the impact of those fears and anxieties on your life. Know that it is going to be ok, no matter what.</p><p>The Nine of Swords reversed also suggests that your worry and despair may actually be causing you harm. The more you worry about something, the more likely it is you will manifest your worst nightmares. Do not let this nightmare become your reality! Take a deep breath and realise that life is not as bad as it seems and that the more you worry, the more harm you are doing to yourself.</p><p>It is also possible that you have already worked through this period of worry and depression and are beginning to make a recovery. You may have recently come to the realisation that it is not as bad as you had made it out to be, and you are beginning to relax and calm yourself about what was once a terrifying situation.</p><p>You may also find that your dreams are very telling at this time. Use a dream journal to help you analyse what is happening at a subconscious level.</p>"

    "name": "Ten of Swords",
    "id": "tenofswords",
    "img": "images/tenofswords.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Ten of Swords usually symbolises a sudden and unexpected failure or disaster, whereby a power beyond your control crushes you without warning or mercy. Sometimes you will be able to alter the course of this impending disaster but most of the time you will simply have to let go and take the hit. This card can also indicate a time when you have been backstabbed or betrayed by someone you thought you could trust. You feel incredibly hurt and shocked by such a betrayal.</p><p>As such, the Ten of Swords is often associated with feeling the ‘victim’ in a situation. You may feel powerless as something comes to a crashing and sudden end, and you feel as if you are being attacked or backstabbed by someone else. You crave pity from others with a small sigh of, “Poor me!” You may even use this challenging time to portray yourself as a martyr, to show that you have put your interests last but have suffered as a result.</p><p>The Ten of Swords also indicates a difficult experience of endings, loss, pain or release. However, the saving grace is that you have a new awareness and a positive sense of relief that the difficulty and pain will soon be over and will evolve into something new. As with all endings there will be a new beginning, a rebirth, and a rejuvenation of the spirit. So, while this card may seem negative at first glance, it is a card of hope and an indication that your troubles will not be permanent.</p><p>Furthermore, this is the final ordeal, and no more pain will come to you from that source. It is darkest before the dawn, and as gloomy as it looks, the sun will rise again. It can only get better from here.</p><p>The Ten of Swords is about letting go and accepting your current circumstances. You no longer resist change but allow it to happen, even if it causes some initial pain and hurt to you. You accept that there must be change in order to facilitate renewal, and you allow it to occur rather than fighting it.</p><p>When this card appears after a painful situation, it is a signal to pick yourself up off the ground and to reflect upon what happened to you and why, and what you can learn from the experience. Hidden deep beneath the surface of the Ten of Swords is the ultimate power of the Swords suit – the ability to analyse the situation and your responses, and learn from yourself. True wisdom does not come from without but from within. The Ten of Swords is a sign that the pain and hurt you have endured has not gone without purpose. The positive power within you can be used to learn from your pain and draw wisdom from defeat.</p><p>It is worth noting that the Ten of Swords is very similar to the Death card of the Major Arcana. It is not a literal indication of actual death but is instead evidence of an impending change or ending which may initially be difficult to accept.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Ten of Swords reversed indicates a painful ending which must occur for there to be growth and regeneration. The suit of Swords is the suit of thoughts, plans, and attitudes, and this card is very appropriate in the area of mental transformations. This card indicates that there will be a forceful re-evaluation or elimination of your previous attitudes about life, your views about yourself and what is important, and possibly your plans for the future. Despite the initial trauma and torment associated with this change, the imposed re-evaluation can be a very positive thing. It is important to understand that while the means of your demise may not seem reasonable or fair, your previous thoughts and attitudes really need to change in order for you to reach a better place in your life. Rather than dwelling on the painful ending, it is important to look ahead and realise how these events free you up to completely reshape your life and choose a new direction for yourself.</p><p>The reversed Ten of Swords may also indicate that you are resisting an inevitable ending, because you are deeply worried about how much it is going to hurt you. However, what you are doing is delaying the inevitable and possibly making it even worse for yourself because you keep trying to put off something that needs to happen anyway for your own personal transformation. For example, a relationship may have come to an end but you are still intimate with your ex because you cannot bear to let go. This is only drawing out the pain much longer, and it is best to completely let go at this stage.</p><p>Sometimes, the Ten of Swords reversed may reflect fear of ruin, even if that ruin as not yet occurred. You are always be thinking of the worst-case scenario and planning for the worst, even if it does not happen. This is only creating unnecessary fear and anxiety for you, and it is important that you return to the energy of the Nine of Swords and run a reality check as to whether things are as bad as they seem.</p><p>The Ten of Swords reversed represents an old situation that ended very badly. You are still carrying around wounds from that situation but you have buried them so deeply that you do not realise they are still present in your life and still hurting you. This old pain needs to be brought up and dealt with once and for all, so you can liberate yourself from these deeply inflicted wounds. It may be difficult to experience the pain again but at least you are releasing yourself of this pain and allowing it to pass from your life.</p>"

    "img": "images/pageofswords.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Page of Swords reflects an abundance of energy, passion and enthusiasm. You cannot wait to get started on a new project or an idea, and to share that with others. You start all new projects, ventures and journeys with a huge amount of energy and excitement. The challenge, however, is whether you can keep it up! As with all Pages, the beginning always looks promising but something else is needed in order to maintain the pace.</p><p>The Page of Swords is almost like a green light to say, “Go for it”. There are always going to be challenges with whatever option you choose and not everyone is going to be happy with your choices but when it comes down to it, you need to follow your passions and go where your true energy lies. This Page encourages you to move forward and to get the wheels in motion, despite any challenges or setbacks that may potentially stand in the way.</p><p>This card shows you as a young and idealistic person, with lots of plans and ideas for the future. At this moment, you feel as though you could do almost anything. As a Page, you are just beginning to make your way in life, and it is important that you align with others who will not overwhelm you or stifle your direction and ideas. Instead, seek to align yourself with people who will nurture your ideas and will help you to manifest them in an organised manner. Choose a relationship that feels natural, with someone who will learn and grow along with you and give you a chance to develop your own personality and expression. You have an intelligent and sensitive nature, and you may suffer a lot if there is no outlet for your ideas and feelings.</p><p>The Page of Swords is as perceptive as the Queen of Swords. He has the ability to find out the truth regarding all matters by asking all the important questions. However, what makes him different to the Queen is that he lacks experience and maturity, so his questioning and probing may become annoying to others as he constantly asks “Why?” Nonetheless, he has both mental and physical agility and is full of anticipation, making him an avid learner and an excellent student.</p><p>The Page of Swords is also all about communication, information and ideas. This card is an indication that you need to appreciate and communicate ideas, information and theories. These ideas, information and theories may be your own or someone else’s. It does not really matter, so long as you are involved in talking, sharing and conversing with others about these ideas. You are always coming up with something new and then finding someone to share it with. You also have a way with words, being a good writer or speaker, and you are passionate about what you are doing. However, be careful that you do not engage in gossip. While this Page loves to talk and to be ‘in the know’, it is important that you use this talent to benefit others, rather than to create negativity. You may also want to be careful about what you say to whom, as you may be more prone to sharing confidential information about yourself. So, protect your privacy. And you may need to first ground your thoughts, before speaking, in order to ensure that you do not later regret what you have said.</p><p>The Page of Swords can also stand for a child or young-at-heart adult whose relationship to you involves truthfulness, the search for information and new ideas, or matters of the mind and intellect. You may have your moments with this Page, as the Swords often indicate a level of tension or conflict, and this bundle of energy may sometimes prove too much to handle. If you need to, give yourself a break from this youthful person, and return with fresh eyes. They do have a lot to share with you, and despite their inexperience, they may actually teach you something about yourself. You need to remain open to their high levels of energy and enthusiasm to learn more about the world. As a child, the Page of Swords encourages you to have fun with mental activities of all kinds, including learning, exploring, and researching. Enjoy the world of thought your mind can open to you.</p><p>The downside of the Page of Swords is the turbulent nature of intellectual discovery and inspiration unchecked by experience or wisdom. This Page seems to be either on the defensive, protecting his ideas, or on the offensive, looking for some victim of the double-edged sword of his mind. Perhaps he is seeking a confrontation in the intellectual sense or has the desire to prove himself mentally superior to others. The trouble is that he does not yet have the maturity to express himself in a way that is always constructive, and may come across as oppositional or just too ‘in your face’.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>Reversed, the Page of Swords can suggest you are acting hastily, without thinking things through properly. You have a lot of energy behind you to get things moving but the way you are going about it is not an effective use of your energy. Tackle things one at a time, rather than trying to deal with everything at once. This will lead to more meaningful outcomes.</p><p>The reversed Page of Swords can also be all talk and no action. You have to be very careful of making promises that you know you cannot keep, or saying things that you later regret. Before making a specific promise or commitment, ensure that you can and will deliver on it in order to maintain your integrity and reputation. Also, be wary of other people’s commitments to you and put in place measures to ensure that they will deliver on what they promise to deliver. This reversed Page can be a bit of a ‘know-it-all’ and may be trying to impress you with big stories about his past and his achievements (which you later find out are big exaggerations of the truth!).</p><p>The Page of Swords reversed may also indicate that you are beginning to annoy others by your constant questioning and challenging of ideas. While you may simply be trying to understand a situation or a concept better, there are more constructive and non-threatening ways to go about it. Use sentences such as, “Help me understand...” Be conscious of how you may be coming across to others when you are constantly asking, “Why?” And only challenge or question those ideas that are really important to you, rather than challenging everything that is presented.</p><p>Finally, the reversed Page of Swords suggests a fear of public speaking. You may be anxious that you do not have sufficient experience or knowledge to present on a particular topic, or you may be afraid of being the centre of attention. Know that people simply want to hear your point of view, even if it is different from others’.</p>"

    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>When we are obsessed by an idea and wish to manifest that idea, we are often so blinded by the desire for its fulfilment that we fail to see the difficulties we may encounter or the consequences of our actions. The Knight of Swords is a powerful figure full of life and energy who needs to be balanced with a realisation of responsibility and compassion. Once he has set forth on his journey, there is no stopping him! He does not see, nor care about, any upcoming challenges, risks or dangers, and instead moves forward with his strong intent to succeed and win. On the positive side, this card shows great ambition, determination and strength to succeed no matter what. On the negative side, however, he can be blind to potential challenges and consequences of his actions, and may charge forth into a dangerous territory without any foresight or preparation. He may also neglect to understand the needs of others as he fervently pursues his own goals.</p><p>The Knight of Swords often reflects a time when you are embarking on a new project or idea and there really is no stopping you. You have had this sudden burst of energy that is propelling you forward and inspiring you to take quick action to manifest your goals. You are ready to overcome any problem, challenge or obstacle that is in your path. How could anything stand in your way if you are this focused and this committed to your goal? However, you may be prone to rushing things or cutting corners in order to get a job done. Sometimes this works for you but other times it does not. For example, using low cost providers will help you get the job done quickly and cheaply but quality may suffer in the long-term and you may consume more time fixing their work. Also, ensure that you keep others on side, particularly if they are part of your longer-term success. You might be all fired up and ready to go but if your colleagues, partner, friends, or family are not, then you are likely to run into trouble later down the track.</p><p>The Knight of Swords also represents your need to understand the world from an intellectual point of view. You have well-developed communication skills and can easily form solid arguments and opinions on current affairs and important matters. You love to engage with others who have similar skills so that you can share your ideas and develop new points of view. You may be best suited to discussion groups with like-minded individuals where you can fire each other up and motivate one another.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>This reversed Knight is incredibly impatient, impulsive and bursting with energy. This person has so much energy but so little direction that this results in them making rash decisions and pulling down others with them. Their thoughts are scattered and all over the place. They are likely to be very disorganised, flippant and unpredictable. If you encounter this type of person, you need to be very wary and make sure that you do not get caught up in all the hype and energy that surrounds them. It will be easily done for this person is a greater talker and is full of ideas and thoughts about future opportunities. Do not get sucked in to their whirlwind of activity and energy!</p><p>The Knight of Swords reversed indicates that you need to go it alone in order to build up valuable life experience and maturity. As you search for freedom and independence, it is likely you will make mistakes on your way due to your reckless and impatient nature but this is all part of the journey. This card can often reflect a rebellious teenager who is fighting for their own independence, and the parents who need to allow that teenager to make the mistakes and to be accountable for their actions.</p><p>The reversed Knight of Swords can also suggest that you need to slow down otherwise you are at risk of serious burn-out and exhaustion. You want to be involved in everything but you are not succeeding at anything due to this scattered thought and energy. As such, you are spinning your wheels and accomplishing very little but growing more and more tired by the day. Take some time out so that you can first ground yourself, gather your thoughts and focus on only the top priorities.</p>"

    "name": "Queen of Swords",
    "id": "queenofswords",
    "img": "images/queenofswords.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Queen of Swords represents the sternness of a mature intellect which is devoid of emotion. In mythology, the feminine is associated with emotion, yet in this card the woman is stern and composed, and without much feeling. This card therefore represents the intellect’s ability to judge and discern impartially, without the influence of emotion or sentimentality. She likes to know the how, what, why, where, when and who of everything to help her make sense of her environment and to better understand others. It is not that she does not care about others but she connects to other people through an intellectual understanding rather than an emotional understanding.</p><p>The Queen of Swords is a sign that you need to be independent in thought and in judgement. You must use your unbiased intelligence in order to make a judgement of a particular situation, drawing upon every piece of information and fact that you have gathered along the way. Empathy or compassion towards others may distract you from the task at hand, so it is important that you think with your head and not with your heart at this particular time. Do not let emotion get in the way. Rather, use fact and logic to make your decisions.</p><p>The Queen of Swords also has an innate ability to tell it like it is. She is a quick thinker and highly perceptive, and as such, she can cut through the noise and confusion to get straight to the point. There is certainly no ‘beating about the bush’, or ‘softening’ of her comments, opinions and thoughts. She is upfront and honest about her opinions, and expects the same from others. The best way to interact with the Queen of Swords, therefore, is to remain as impartial as possible, and to present your thoughts and opinions concisely and honestly.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Queen of Swords reversed indicates that currently you may be thinking more with your heart than your head. You may be very emotionally involved in a particular situation or issue but this may be distorting your perception of the situation at hand. You need to use your head a little bit more to understand what is happening and read the signals more accurately. Look at your situation objectively and think with your head and not your heart as this may give you a better picture of the situation and help you evaluate what you need to do next.</p><p>Similarly, the reversed Queen of Swords suggests that relationships are clouding your usually clear vision. You need to refocus your goals or direction, yet you are hesitating due to a desire not to disturb the positive balance and harmony of your relationships with others. At the end of the day, you need to be more hard-edged, confident and assertive in order to be successful. Clear sight and analysis, objective weighing of options and ideas for the future, and even carefully considering but not necessarily choosing, the alternatives are essential right now.</p><p>On the other hand, the reversed Queen of Swords can come across as cold-hearted, bitter, resentful and bitchy, particularly if she is completely devoid of any emotion or compassion for others. In her quest to get to the bottom of an issue, she puts a lot of other people off-side and loses her support base. She isolates herself from others and is seen as narrow-minded, intolerant, and mean.</p>"

    "name": "King of Swords",
    "id": "kingofswords",
    "img": "images/kingofswords.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The King of Swords is a symbol of intellectual power and authority, and has the courage and intellect to accomplish all that he desires. He represents judgement, command, and rulership. His character indicates the stern leadership of a judge, lawyer, or military commander whose emotions must be kept in check under the pressure of battle. Therefore, the King of Swords asks you to remain detached and objective in a specific situation, in order to ascertain the truth and seek out only the facts. You need to use your intellect to prove your point and succeed. Your education and experience are important but so are your day-to-day observations and thoughts. You can also solve problems by using history, rules, laws and diplomacy.</p><p>The King of Swords suggests that you need to adopt a very stern but fair role. You have clarity of mind and can perceive the truth right now, so you must take the lead with providing an objective point of view. You are well-positioned to judge your situation appropriately and identify the limiting behaviours that are getting in the way. This is a time when you need to leave emotions out of it, and remain as objective and rational as possible. You may need to reason with others and be quite direct about what you are observing. You may be concerned that you are not being particularly caring or sympathetic but at this point in time, this detachment is what is needed most.</p><p>Similarly, the King of Swords encourages you to use your logic and intellect to navigate your path ahead. You will need to get to the heart of the matter, make firm and well-researched decisions, and ensure that you are firm but fair in your dealings with others. You need to be able to take any situation, look at it with total impartiality, and then come to a decision that is both fair and insightful.</p><p>Oftentimes, the King of Swords represents a professional advisor, such as a solicitor or attorney, financial adviser or taxation consultant. This advisor has a solid reputation and a vast amount of knowledge in his particular field, and will provide you with objective, well-researched advice about your own situation. He is completely impartial, and will draw upon his experience and his innate knowledge of the rules, systems and structures that are in place. He may come across as detached or disinterested in your personal circumstances, unless it relates specifically to the type of advice he is giving you. This is so that he can provide only the most relevant and objective advice to you. He prides himself in his expertise and qualifications, and is likely to charge a high fee for his services. Nonetheless, he offers the rigour and specialist knowledge that you need right now.</p><p>If you have not engaged the help of an expert, the appearance of the King of Swords suggests that it may be worthwhile getting some legal or financial advice. If you are expecting changes or particular circumstances to arise that will require expert advice, you can be on the front foot by seeking advice before they happen. That way, when they do roll through, you are ready to demand your rights and seek an outcome that benefits you. You may also benefit by finding an advocate or mentor who will look out for your needs and who can provide you with objective and smart advice about what to do.</p><p>This King is also a man of the highest ethical standards. It is impossible to corrupt him and as such he acts as a pillar of strength who gives sound advice to everyone, no matter who they are. What is more, he firmly expects others to operate by the rules of the law and will not tolerate others who break the law. As a father, for example, he will become very angry if his children do not follow the ‘house rules’.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The King of Swords reversed can suggest the misuse of one’s mental power, authority, and drive. The reversed King of Swords represents manipulation and persuasion in order to fulfil selfish needs. He is a very intelligent older male (or sometimes female) who likes to show off to others about how smart he is by using big words or talking about topics about which no-one else knows. He may also be very cutting in his words, critical of others, and stern in his manner. This card may represent a person in your life or even yourself. You need to be wary of this type of person because, although he/she may be charming and intelligent, they can do only harm. They have only their personal interests in mind and will do whatever they can to achieve these interests, even if it means stepping on others.</p><p>Similarly, the King of Swords reversed can be quite a tyrant and a ‘loose cannon’. He is prone to aggression and angry outbursts, particularly if you make him look bad or challenge his authority. He is not pleasant to be around and is likely to leave you feeling demoralised and put down.</p><p>The reversed King of Swords can also reflect a lack of decisiveness about where your best opportunities lie or in what direction you want to head. You are still making up your mind about what you really want to do and what is going to inspire you. This lack of decision means a lack of direction at this time, so it is essential that you drive energy towards making a decision and then acting upon it. The longer you wait around until everything is 100% clear, the longer you delay your fulfilment. You may also be lacking the mental clarity to work out what it is that you need to do in your situation. Your thoughts are scattered and may be starting to feel quite panicky and out of control when it comes to knowing exactly what to do and what choices to make. Upright, the King is typically a very rational man who uses his intelligence and clear understanding of a situation to make critical decisions but reversed, this card indicates that you are feeling very lost and uncertain about your options, let alone the decisions you need to make. As a result, you are delaying necessary decisions and generally not achieving anything because you are getting so worried.</p>"

    "name": "Ace of Pentacles",
    "id": "aceofpentacles",
    "img": "images/aceofpentacles.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Ace of Pentacles, like the Aces of the other Tarot suits, represents new beginnings, opportunities, and potential, and as a Pentacles card, these new beginnings are associated with the material world – finances, wealth, career, physical health and manifestation of your goals. You may be presented with a new job, a large and unexpected sum of money, a new business or investment opportunity, or the chance to bring an idea into fruition. No matter what the opportunity is, the Ace of Pentacles heralds a feeling of prosperity and abundance, and comes as a welcome invitation to a new beginning in the material or financial areas of your life. Of course, as with all Aces in the Tarot deck, this card represents the potential and possibility of a new opportunity, but it does not guarantee its manifestation or success. Instead, it is up to you to decide whether you will accept this opportunity and turn it into something tangible and real. Even with the positive energy of the Ace of Pentacles, you now need to continue to put the work in to create your own success.</p><p>The Ace of Pentacles is symbolic of wealth, not just in the financial sense but also in a holistic sense. You may see new opportunities come your way that generate a new source of income, or you may be lucky enough to receive a financial gift or windfall. Or, you may have the opportunity to create wealth in a broader sense – happiness, fulfillment, potential, and love. This Ace indicates abundance and wealth in all areas of your life and a general feeling that you are indeed blessed and deserving of everything that comes your way. If you wish to amplify this feeling of wealth even more, live by the Law of Attraction by sending out positive energy and intent into the Universe so you will receive abundance in return.</p><p>The Ace of Pentacles indicates the initial stages of manifestating your goals. You are moving into a more positive state of mind where you realise that you are truly capable of achieving what it is you have set your mind to. Now, your ideas are ready to be turned into something tangible and real. Thus, the Ace of Pentacles sees you starting to map out how exactly you will achieve your goals by creating targeted action plans and getting those actions underway. There are opportunities that are becoming available to you that will help you to manifest your goals and realise your inner potential, whilst at the same time generate some level of income and financial support. You are beginning to see that the world is indeed your oyster and that through careful planning, you can manifest your true goals and desires.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>When the Ace of Pentacles reversed appears in a Tarot reading, you may feel some hesitation about proceeding with an offer, invitation or opportunity, particularly one that relates to your work, career, finances, or business. You may be second-guessing whether the opportunity is as good as it looks, or whether you have what it takes to see it through. The timing may not be right and it may not come to fruition as expected. Assess the feasibility of your idea before proceeding. You may not decline the offer straight away, but it would be wise to do your due diligence and figure out if this opportunity is meant for you or not</p><p>The Ace of Pentacles reversed may indicate that a financial opportunity may fall through unexpectedly. The opportunity may be a pay raise, a new job, a loan, or a financial offer. Although the offer has been made to you, the other party may retract the offer without explanation or warning. As the saying goes, “Don’t count your chickens before they hatch!” So if an offer is made to you, wait until the money is in your bank account before going ahead and spending it or celebrating.</p><p>Similarly, the Ace of Pentacles reversed indicates that you need to be very careful about what you can and cannot afford. When the card is reversed, it appears as if the coin is about to fall out of the magical hand and money will be lost. Do not get in over your head and take on a mortgage that requires huge monthly repayments. Do not rely on the promise of a financial opportunity in the future (like a pay raise or a gift). Allow some ‘fat’ in your budgeting in case you are without employment at any time or have a large and unexpected financial outlay.</p><p>At times, the reversed Ace of Pentacles suggests that you are trying to manifest your goals but you are not getting very far along due to delays and other impediments to your plans. If your success is limited, then you may need to re-evaluate and modify your plans and proposed approach. Your goals may also need to be realigned to something more realistic. Financial or other professional advice may be needed to help you get back on track.</p><p>If you are considering starting a new business or taking up a new job offer, the reversed Ace of Pentacles warns that there is a significant risk to success due to lack of planning and foresight. You may overlook the financial details of your business plan and head into a new idea blindly, without an indication of whether or not there is indeed a market for your services. You may also rush into creating a business, without doing the planning that needs to sit behind it. You need to plan more and have more foresight and consideration into the financial aspects that align to your passions and career interests.</p>"

    "name": "Two of Pentacles",
    "id": "twoofpentacles",
    "img": "images/twoofpentacles.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>When the Two of Pentacles appears in a Tarot reading, you are juggling multiple priorities, roles and responsibilities. For example, you may be a working parent, a general manager of a business, an administrative assistant in a busy office, or someone who works multiple jobs. You need to manage your time, energy and resources very carefully so that you do not lose your balance. When this card is in the upright position, you are doing a good job of balancing these multiple priorities and you can take on whatever life throws at you; but it is a very fine line between coping with these demands and totally losing control.</p><p>The Two of Pentacles often appears when you are experiencing a state of ‘busyness’, rushing from one thing to the next, with little downtime in between. You may be constantly telling yourself that you don’t have enough time or you’re in a rush. However, keep in mind that you don't have to be busy to get things done. Sometimes taking a break is the most productive thing you can do. You may also want to change your mindset and feel into the possibility that you have exactly the right amount of time to do what you need to do.</p><p>Similarly, the Two of Pentacles can appear when you are getting caught up in the day-to-day demands, but losing sight of the bigger picture. If this resonates, ask yourself, What do I want my life to look like? And how can I reorganise my schedule to create my dream life?</p><p>The Two of Pentacles invites you to manage your time and your priorities carefully. Your workload is high right now, and in order to get everything done, you need to stay focused and productive. You may benefit from a ‘to do’ list, better calendar management and a stricter schedule. You may even enlist the support of an assistant or time management coach to help you do this. Basic time management is critical to your ability to juggle these multiple priorities and keep your head above water. This card also reminds you to pay special attention to your general administration, including paying bills managing finances, keeping on top of your commitments and maintaining your diary. Be careful that you do not miss important deadlines, meetings and other commitments that you have made.</p><p>This card brings your awareness to the concept of balance in your life right now. While you can seek out balance and equilibrium, nothing is ever in perfect balance (and if it is, everything is in a state of change so it is likely to get out of balance shortly after). For example, you may be trying to balance your work and family commitments, but in reality, family might be more important one week, and work the next. So when this card appears in a Tarot reading, it is a reminder to be patient, flexible and adaptable as you attempt to juggle your commitments with your family, your friends, work, finances, health and new challenges. Be prepared to swap around activities or accommodate last minute requests. And know that if you are succeeding in one area of your life, it’s very likely you’re struggling in another – that’s just part of the balancing act!</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>In your day-to-day life, the reversed Two of Pentacles suggests that you are very busy and at times you struggle to manage your activities and commitments. Your schedule is over-loaded and you are starting to drop the ball. Or, you may be struggling to manage your finances and to stay on top of paying bills and keeping abridge of other financial commitments. The stress is getting to you, and you are becoming easily overwhelmed by your responsibilities. The lesson with the reversed Two of Pentacles is to get organised and get on top of your commitments. You may need to bring more structure to your day-to-day affairs through budgets, to do lists, forward planning or diary and effective time management. Or, you may need to start saying ‘no’ to opportunities that are no longer in alignment with your goals.</p><p>The reversed Two of Pentacles can also be a sign that you are struggling to manage your multiple commitments and obligations and you are over-investing in one area of your life, at the expense of other areas. For example, you may be highly successful in your career, but have little time for your family or your partner, leaving them feeling disconnected and alone. While you may be able to get away with a couple of late nights at work, there will come a time when enough is enough, and you will need to make a choice. Something has to give.</p><p>The invitation of the Two of Pentacles reversed is to reassess your priorities and goals and decide where you want to spend your time and energy. Right now, you are being spread too thin and are trying to do too many things at once. Or, you may be at the mercy of other people’s demands, but at the expense of your personal well-being. Distractions are aplenty and it is going to take every ounce of your focus and concentration to ensure that you stay true to your personal goals. Choose the one thing you need to focus on so you can give it your undivided attention and you will reach success.</p>"

    "name": "Three of Pentacles",
    "id": "threeofpentacles",
    "img": "images/threeofpentacles.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Three of Pentacles indicates that you are collaborating with others and creating synergies to achieve big results. The stonemason couldn’t build the cathedral without the help of the architects, and the architects couldn’t build it without the stonemason. Each person has an important role to play and when they come together as a team, they are able to create something much bigger than if they were to do it in their own. So, when this card appears in a Tarot reading, it is a sign to work collaboratively with others and come together as a team.</p><p>Similarly, the Three of Pentacles represents the value of different ideas and levels of experience when it comes to collaboration. The architects respect the specialised knowledge of the stonemason, and the stonemason respects the wisdom and experience of the architects. Even though their backgrounds, experience levels and knowledge are very different, they are able to come together to share their expertise in a way that creates synergy and improved results. There is no ‘us and them’ or any sense of superiority. Rather, each person has something unique to offer and is willing to learn from others involved in the project. Everyone is getting the job done together and is contributing to the group through effective listening and sharing. As you work on projects with others, acknowledge the value that each person brings to the table. You will also learn from each member of the team when you see their unique value.</p><p>The Three of Pentacles, like the Threes in the other suits, represents the initial stages of implementation that follow the idea phase of the Ace and the planning phase of the Two. You know what you want to create, laid out the plans, and gathered your resources (money, people and time); now it is time to put it into action. You are at the beginning stages of bringing your goals to fruition and may have already reached your first important milestone. Of course, you are nowhere near the finish line just yet – there is still a way to go – but you have got the ball rolling and you are making things happen.</p><p>As you start to implement your plans, it is also becoming clear to you that you have the skills, capabilities and resources you need to accomplish your goals. See the Three of Pentacles as a sign of encouragement that you are on the right track – you are competent at what you do and you are making progress. Keep going! Your desire for fulfilling work is coming to fruition and you can be truly proud of what you are creating. Your dreams can be made real with persistence, determination and effort. Effective planning, management and organisation are also key components of the Three of Pentacles. In order to accomplish significant goals, such as building a monumental cathedral, it is imperative that detailed planning occurs to ensure that all the components are progressing well. This card, therefore, reflects a time when it is essential to create a detailed plan and to follow a schedule. This is when good project management will pay off.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>Reversed, the Three of Pentacles indicates you may be experiencing a lack of harmony with fellow team members, making it difficult to complete a task or project. You're not on the same page as one another or you're not listening or valuing one another's opinions and ideas. If this resonates, you need to realign with the original goals of the project, and make new agreements about how you will work together to achieve those goals. You may need to renegotiate timelines, resources, and the amount of energy you each put in to the project, so that you are all back on the same page again. Given the upright Three of Pentacles is about good planning and organisation, the reversal of this card can suggest that you need to bring more of this energy into your work. If you do not have a clear view of how you will accomplish your goals, then it will be beneficial to stop work momentarily and plan out your next steps at a detailed level</p><p>There may also be a lack of respect between team members, with individuals trying to prove themselves and gain superiority over other members of the team. If this is the case, set some clear guidelines for the team, especially around respect and collaboration. Acknowledge the unique contribution each person makes, no matter their experience or knowledge. The Three of Pentacles reversed can also indicate that you are working in a fairly mundane job in which your contributions and experience are not appreciated or valued. There is not much opportunity for growth and advancement, and you feel as if your skills and capabilities are not being effectively utilised. It may be a good time to make a career move and find somewhere where your skills are more valued.</p><p>At times, the Three of Pentacles reversed can indicate that you prefer to go it alone and get the job done yourself. You may be fed up waiting for others or you feel you could do a better job yourself. At times, this may be true. However, if you find yourself struggling, be open to ask for help.</p>"

    "name": "Four of Pentacles",
    "id": "fourofpentacles",
    "img": "images/fourofpentacles.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Four of Pentacles asks you to look at your relationship with money. Are you accumulating wealth and investing your money wisely, while still enjoying your day-to-day life? Or are you desperately clinging to every coin, afraid to spend your money in fear that you may not have enough or may lose it forever?</p><p>In its most positive state, the Four of Pentacles suggests that you have created wealth and abundance by maintaining a steady focus on your goals and acting conservatively. You are focused on your long-term financial security, actively saving money and watching your expenses so that you can accumulate wealth and live a comfortable lifestyle not just now but also in the future. You may be considering your savings plan, family budget, retirement plan, and investments so that you can protect what you have accumulated over time, and slowly and steadily you increase your net worth through saving money and safe investments.</p><p>However, the Four of Pentacles can indicate a scarcity mindset, especially when it comes to money and material possessions. Instead of spending your money and enjoying a comfortable lifestyle, you are choosing to stockpile your finances, in fear that you might lose it all or someone else might take it away. Your budget may be so conservative or strict that you are foregoing many of life’s pleasures, including travel, social occasions, gifts, or fun activities – but for what purpose? Money works best when it is in a state of flow and exchange, not when it is being stashed away. Deep down you may be starting to realise that you are foregoing happiness and fulfillment in your life because you do not want to spend any of your money and you have sold out for a conservative and overly safe approach to life. If this resonates, find a healthy balance between spending and saving, so that you can enjoy the fruits of your labour but also save up for the future.</p><p>The Four of Pentacles can also suggest that you are placing too much value on money and material possessions. You may be overly attached to material things, and possessions have become your life. You now assess your self-worth based on how much you earn, the type of car you drive, how expensive your home is, and where you take your holidays. But, it’s a catch 22 because as your standard of living increases, so too does the need to continually work hard to generate income to sustain this kind of lifestyle, leaving you with little time to actually enjoy your wealth.</p><p>The deeper lesson with the Four of Pentacles is to honour and respect money and wealth, but don’t become so attached that you lose sight of what’s really important to you – friends, family, happiness and love.</p><p>If you are struggling with your finances, then the Four of Pentacles comes as wise advice to manage your money and resources more carefully so that you do not live beyond your means. Make sure that you do not spend more than you earn and that you have a budget and savings plan in place so that you can reach your financial goals and live a secure and stable life. Beyond money and wealth, the Four of Pentacles appears when you are seeking out more control in your life. At work, you may be micro-managing or not letting others mess around with your area. In a relationship, you may be quite protective, even possessive, ensuring that no-one else threatens what you have already established. On a personal level, you may be more inclined to hoard this week rather than let go of your possessions. You may have an inflexible attitude that is resistant to change. You have already established a way of living that now works for you, so why change? You may see change as a threat to your certainty, safety and security in life, and any change may place you at risk of losing all that is important to you. Any suggestion of doing things differently is, therefore, going to be met with resistance for fear of how it will impact your personal sense of security. So, ‘playing it safe’ may simply be the way to go rather than taking any risks at this point.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed Four of Pentacles can appear when you are re-evaluating what’s important to you, especially when it comes to money and wealth. You may have placed too much value on material possessions and have now come to the realization that money and ‘things’ won’t make you happy – only love will make you happy. As a result, you may be loosening your grip on the need to surround yourself with ‘things’, in favour of seeking out more love and happiness in your life instead. You might be compelled to declutter your home or opt for a minimalist lifestyle. Money is no longer your number one priority and you are redefining your relationship with material possessions and money.</p><p>The Four of Pentacles reversed can indicate that money is slipping through your fingers and your spending habits exceed your saving habits. You may be spending unconsciously, hoping it will bring happiness, but all it does is bring you more stress and anxiety as your bank balance declines.</p><p>At times, the reversed Four of Pentacles can suggest that your love for money has turned to greed. You want more, more, more – but at what cost? In the quest to earn more money, you may be working longer hours but neglecting your loved ones. Or, if you have your own business, you may be pushing sales harder to generate more profit, but at the expense of your customers’ well-being. Look at the overall equation of cost versus benefit, and assess whether your quest for ‘more’ is really bringing you the happiness that you most desire.</p><p>Finally, the Four of Pentacles can appear in a Tarot reading when you are in self-protection mode. You have a strong desire for security, stability and certainty and you are doing everything within your power to create a stable environment for yourself. Even when your outer world seems chaotic and in a constant state of change, you can create more certainty for yourself by controlling your inner environment. You might find tidying the house or organizing your things to be calming and relaxing under these circumstances.</p>"

    "id": "fiveofpentacles",
    "img": "images/fiveofpentacles.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Five of Pentacles is a card of financial loss and poverty. You have hit hard times, especially when it comes to your work, career, finances, and material possessions. You may have recently lost your job, your home, your financial security and so on. You no longer feel safe and secure because it has all been stripped away from you in one blow. Your ego may also be bruised, especially since success is often related to financial wealth, and the loss of wealth can be a humbling blow to your self-esteem and sense of self-worth. The upside is that this is a Minor Arcana card with temporary effects (rather than a Major Arcana card which has much longer-term effects); this too shall pass.</p><p>In this time of need, the Five of Pentacles suggests that you feel isolated and alone. Just like the two people in the card, you feel as if you have been shut out and left in the cold. You may be wondering, “Why is no-one coming to help me?!” It may appear as if no-one cares any more. However, since the windows in the church are lit up, help is nearby; but you are too focused on your problems to notice. You may be waiting for someone to come and help you, when really, you need to be proactive and ask for help. You need to swallow your pride or let go of your fear of rejection, and reach out for help. There are people who are here to support you – you just need to find them and let them know you need them.</p><p>At times, the Five of Pentacles highlights a ‘lack mindset’. You are sabotaging your ability to create abundance because you are choosing to focus on what you don’t have, rather than what you do have. All you can see is what is lacking or what is going wrong. To shift this energy, look for evidence of what you do have, even if it’s very small or seemingly insignificant, and express your gratitude for the blessings that are in your life. Over time, the positive aspects will continue to grow and soon, ‘lack’ and ‘not having’ will be a thing of the past.</p><p>Similarly, the Five of Pentacles suggests that you are worried that you don’t have ‘enough’ or you may lose something important to you – even if it hasn’t happened yet or if there is little to no evidence that it will happen. For example, you may live in fear that you will lose your job and will be left in the streets with no home and no support. If you stay focused on all the negative things that might happen, then be careful, because your super manifesting powers may start to kick in and create the outcomes that you don’t want. Instead, redirect your attention to what you have now and what you want in the future, so your manifesting powers are used for good.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Five of Pentacles reversed indicates an end to difficult times, particularly if you have recently suffered a major financial loss or job loss. You may find new sources of income, a new job, or someone has offered to help you out while you get back on your feet. You may be starting to feel as if life is worth living again and starting to regain your self-confidence. Finally, you can see a way out of your financial difficulties and your hope is renewed.</p><p>The reversed Five of Pentacles can sometimes indicate the persistence of inner, spiritual poverty. You may feel as though something is missing or completely out of place, but you are struggling to put your finger on what it is. You may also feel isolated and alone, even if you are surrounded by many people. On deeper reflection, you may come to realise that you have placed too much emphasis on your material wealth and have neglected your spiritual well-being. You may be worried that you don’t have ‘enough’, especially when it comes to money and material possessions, and that you are not worthy because you are not wealthy. Perhaps you feel that you do not deserve expensive, luxury items, or that you cannot afford the things you truly want. You may worry that if you spend your money now, you won't have enough for later. Or perhaps you're spending your money on the things that don't truly matter for you, leaving you little for the things you truly want. It is a negative cycle because these fears, worries and concerns are leading you to feel even more spiritually unfulfilled and ‘empty’.</p><p>If you are finding your fixation on material things is causing harm to your spirit and your mindset, then it's time to stop. Forget about what you don't have, and instead focus on what you do have. Even if you have just a few cents to your name, you may still have a loving family or a beating heart. Yes, things may suck right now, but the truth is, you can change this simply by changing your thoughts. And if you hear this poverty mindset coming through in your thoughts, pause for a moment and ask yourself whether this idea of 'I can't afford it' is really true, or if it is an illusion. Is it really an issue of not valuing yourself enough to invest in yourself? Trust that the Universe is here to support you financially, especially when you are following your calling and your soul purpose. Trust that when you truly value something, you'll make it happen.</p>"

    "name": "Six of Pentacles",
    "id": "sixofpentacles",
    "img": "images/sixofpentacles.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Six of Pentacles is a card of giving and receiving. Sometimes, you are on the giving end; other times, you are on the receiving end. It’s an ongoing cycle of life, and this card serves as a reminder that the balance can change at any time. Even if you are surrounded by wealth, there will be times when you need the help and support of others, so it is important to be generous with your resources as you may need the support in the future.</p><p>You may be like the wealthy man in this card, sharing your wealth and abundance with others. You have accumulated great wealth and are now in a position where you can offer financial assistance to those in need. You give generously through charitable donations, tithing or fundraising and enjoy the good feelings associated with helping others. Even if you are not financially wealthy, you offer up your time, energy, love and support to those who are in need, knowing that it is highly valuable and appreciated. Giving of your time or your wisdom is often just as spiritually fulfilling as giving away money or gifts, and the intangible gift of your presence is received just as well, if not better. There may be times when you wonder if you can truly afford to give generously to others – the wise advice of this card is to trust that every contribution you make is valued and it will come back to you threefold.</p><p>You may also be inclined to make a loan to someone, on the premise that they will eventually pay you back once they are back on their feet. This is a loan built on trust and good faith, knowing that if you give something away, it will come back to you. Remember, though, that this is more about a short-term fix and not a sustainable solution towards self-sufficiency. So, think about how you can financially support your family or friends in a way that encourages them to stand on their own two feet eventually.</p><p>On the other hand, you may be on the receiving end of other people’s generosity, accepting these gifts with gratitude. This will help you to get back on your feet and to eventually repay the charitable organisation or individual, either with your time or your restored wealth. You will also need to identify ways in which you can become more self-sufficient in the long run. The risk of accepting charity is that you become dependent on it and cannot look after yourself. Be mindful that you are not becoming submissive or noticeably desperate as a result of the charity that someone else is providing you.</p><p>Finally, the Six of Pentacles is a card representing being in harmony with your money. The amount that comes in and the amount that flows out are in balance, and you are thankful for what you have without being grasping of it and are happy to share with others in need.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Six of Pentacles reversed reminds you that while you are busy giving to others, make sure you are also giving to yourself. A little self-care will go a long way, especially if you have been in giving mode for a long period of time. Think about how you can give yourself a little gift to show yourself appreciation for everything you've done; maybe a massage, a beautiful box of truffles, or simply a love note written to yourself to say thanks for everything you’ve done.</p><p>The Six of Pentacles reversed can suggest that although you are giving to others freely, they are not giving back in return. For example, you may lend money to a friend, but they don’t pay you back. Or you help someone out, but they fail to return the favour and show a lack of gratitude and appreciation. It’s a one-way street and it may feel as if you are being taken advantage of. While you can’t change the other person’s response or force them to repay you, you can learn from the experience and decline to help in the future. Or, if you do decide to offer help again, suggest an alternative way to pay you back so that there is still a healthy exchange of energy – perhaps they cook a meal for you or offer you a service in return.</p><p>If you are struggling yourself, be careful that you do not over-commit yourself to others who seek your help. You may have a tendency to spend or give away more than you can afford to. While a generous spirit is a wonderful quality, you need to ensure that you are able to support yourself whilst helping others.</p><p>The Six of Pentacles reversed asks you to be mindful about getting into debt. You are prone to getting in over your head and it may come back to bite you with increasing interest rates or personal threats if you are unable to pay it back in time.</p><p>The Six of Pentacles reversed sometimes reflects the selfish side of charity. In some cases, people give to others not for the benefit of the other but for the benefit of themselves. Be careful that you are not trying to prove to others that you are generous because you can give to the poor or the needy. Aim to give selflessly rather than selfishly.</p><p>In a relationship reading, the reversed Six of Pentacles suggests that one partner is doing a lot of the taking but not a lot of the giving, thus creating an inequality in the relationship. You need to be careful that your generous spirit is not being taken advantage of and that you are not always the one making compromises for your partner’s benefit.</p>"

    "id": "sevenofpentacles",
    "img": "images/sevenofpentacles.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Seven of Pentacles shows that you have a strong desire to invest in those things that will provide long-term benefit and sustainable results. You understand the value of putting in time and energy now for longer-term rewards, and you are not necessarily looking for ‘quick wins’. You also want to make sure that you are focusing your attention on the right areas that will give you the biggest ‘bang for your buck’ instead of wasting time on areas that will not deliver any value. When this card appears in a Tarot reading, it is an invitation to step back from the day-to-day operations and look at the bigger picture. Appreciate and celebrate what you have created, and assess and evaluate your progress so far. Are you on track? Are you focused on the right tasks that will lead you to your goal? Similarly, if you are planning for the future, the Seven of Pentacles shows that you are taking a long-term view and you are assessing where you can best invest your time and energy for the maximum output. You do not want to keep putting your heart and soul into something if you are not getting the rewards for it and, no doubt, you have started to see that there are some areas in your life that are just become energy-sappers but without the reward. If you have been working extra hard or putting extra effort into something, it will finally pay off. Your effort will definitely be worth it, and you will see the results and rewards for your labour. You may have been working on something quite challenging and important for the last few months, and this is likely to come to a culmination. You are likely to see financial or other tangible rewards for all of your hard work. Sometimes, however, the Seven of Pentacles can indicate frustration with slow results. You have been labouring away at something important, and you may be starting to feel concerned that you will never be rewarded for your efforts. Be patient and appreciate the progress you have made so far. If your hard work has not yet paid off as planned, remember that your expectations may be unreasonable. There are no guarantees. Be grateful, focus on the present and do what you can with what you have.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed Seven of Pentacles suggests that your efforts may be scattered at this time and you are starting to question whether or not you are investing in the right areas. You may be outlaying some initial money on things that will not deliver results. Or, what you thought would make you happy is actually creating stress and anxiety for you and isn’t worth the effort. Examine where you are investing your time, energy and resources and make sure that you are satisfied with your current progress and that you’re receiving a return on those investments. Use a prioritisation system to ensure that you do not waste time and money on areas that will not deliver results.</p><p>Similarly, the Seven of Pentacles reversed indicates that even though you may continue to invest a lot of energy into a specific situation, you may not reap the rewards you are looking for. As such, this card calls on you to prioritise your activities very carefully. You need to do a cost-benefit analysis of the major tasks involved to bring your project to fruition as there are certainly a number of tasks that are currently taking a lot of your time and energy but are not bearing the rewards you are seeking. Take stock of what you still need to do and focus only on those things that will get you to where you want to be. You may find that there are a lot of things that you get involved in that are just not value-add. For example, email and meetings are huge time wasters if not used effectively. Try to get down to the 20 percent of tasks that deliver 80 percent of the value and focus on these rather than investing your time in tasks that do not deliver any results.</p><p>As a key strength, the reversed Seven of Pentacles can indicate that you know when to stop investing in something when you are seeing little return. Some people are inclined to keep persevering at something even if it is not working out, just because they have already invested a lot of time, energy or money into it. However, you are very good at identifying when a situation is no longer delivering you any value and knowing when to pack it in andtry something else.</p><p>In a relationship reading, the reversed Seven of Pentacles indicates that you have been working very hard on laying the foundations for your relationship, but now, for some reason, you are concerned that you are going to lose all of that. You may also be feeling frustrated that the relationship is not progressing or growing as quickly as you had hoped, particularly given that you have put in so much time and energy. Sometimes you can pour your heart and soul into something, but it does not always mean that there will be results. You may come to the realisation that it just is not worth your time, and no matter how much you try, the relationship is going to continue to hit roadblocks.</p>"

    "name": "Eight of Pentacles",
    "id": "eightofpentacles",
    "img": "images/eightofpentacles.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Eight of Pentacles is a card of apprenticeship and mastery. When this card appears in a Tarot reading, you are working hard to improve your skills and become a master at what you do. You may have recently changed your work, education or financial circumstances, and now you are applying your sheer determination and concentration to master the new skill that you are learning. You are diligent and hard-working and you are applying yourself fully to whatever is at the centre of your attention. As you do the same task over and over, you work your way towards mastery of your craft, and through your perseverance and unwavering attention, you create success.</p><p>The Eight of Pentacles may indicate further education or study in order to hone your skills. You may already be proficient in a particular skill set, but you are now seeking to master those skills. For example, you may be a great home cook, but now you are starting to focus your attention on fine French cuisine. Or perhaps you have learnt the basics of Tarot reading, but now you want to become a Tarot expert! You know that it will require a lot of focus and dedication in your studies, but you are willing to work hard and to pay attention to the details. You know that you will not learn these advanced skills overnight, but you are prepared for the journey towards becoming a master at your chosen expertise.</p><p>More broadly, the Eight of Pentacles suggests you are working away at the finer details of the various aspects of your life, in an effort to continuously improve your situation. You may be unhappy with your current state, and you know you need to make some important changes in your life to increase your overall satisfaction. This card is a positive sign that you are committed to making those changes and to ensuring that you give yourself the best possible chance. Overall, this is a very hard-working and conscientious energy that is present in your life.</p><p>The Eight of Pentacles is encouragement to keep doing what you are doing as it will eventually lead to success. Yes, it requires a lot of dedication, focus and patience but as each day passes and as you stay true to your values and beliefs, you get a little closer to your goal. It may not be as apparent as you may like but events are unfolding that will lead you to the right path. Continue working on yourself, too, and making ongoing improvements and adjustments to ensure that you are the best person you can be.</p><p>If you encounter this card in a reading and are not currently engaged in the active pursuit of your goals, ask yourself what you could learn or create to better yourself or your circumstances. If you are already engaged in the pursuit of new learning, the Eight of Pentacles may be a card of encouragement and reassurance that the energy you invest in your development will be worth your while.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed Eight of Pentacles can appear in a Tarot reading when you are focused on self-improvement and personal development. You are highly disciplined and focused when it comes to understanding your inner beliefs and behaviours, and you are dedicated to becoming the best version of yourself. You may have certain ‘rules’ such as only allowing yourself to think a negative thought for 17 seconds (knowing that after this amount of time it begins to have an increasingly negative impact on your well-being), or recalling three things you’re most grateful for before you go to sleep at night. You are ready and willing to do these things over and over until you see results with your well-being and general happiness.</p><p>Alternatively, the Eight of Pentacles reversed may indicate that you are focused on creating perfection, but to your detriment. When you focus on every tiny detail, you lose sight of the bigger picture and why you're doing the task in the first place. Similarly, your need for perfection may be getting in the way of your ability to adapt and change. You may like to have things done in a certain way, but what if the circumstances change? Can you adapt, or does it throw you into a tailspin? Know that perfection is a myth and surrender to the art of imperfection.</p><p>The reversed Eight of Pentacles suggests that you are working very hard on a project, but it is not leading to the desired outcome. Instead, you’re feeling frustrated and disappointed by the lack of success and progress. You may be lacking the skills and talent that is necessary to be successful and it simply isn’t for you. Or you might be keeping yourself busy with small tasks, but struggling to make progress towards your bigger goals. It is time to take a step back and assess whether you are indeed focused on the right things, or if you need to shift your focus to bring your activities back in alignment with your broader goals.</p>"

    "id": "nineofpentacles",
    "img": "images/nineofpentacles.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Nine of Pentacles indicates that you have worked hard to create abundance in your life, and now you can finally enjoy the fruits of your labour. As a result of your independent efforts, self-confidence and discipline, you have attained well-deserved success and have created a secure, stable foundation for your material wealth and comfort. Now, you can sit back, relax and enjoy the luxuries and pleasures of the good life – money, leisure time, pleasure, material comfort and rest. You deserve it!</p><p>When the Nine of Pentacles appears in a Tarot reading, do not be afraid to splurge, indulge or pamper yourself, particularly if it is a reward for all of your hard work. Treat yourself to a special occasion or a personal gift, to celebrate the journey you have been on. You have already achieved so much, and while you may not be at the finish line just yet, this is your opportunity to reward yourself for what you have achieved, and re-energise yourself for the final phase.</p><p>The Nine of Pentacles also speaks of financial independence. The woman in this card has created a luxurious lifestyle, by her own actions and efforts. She encourages you to do the same – to create abundance and independence so that you can take care of yourself in the long-term. Invest wisely and seek out financial advice so that you can make the most of your wealth. Don’t rely on others to support you – create your own wealth and independence, and use discipline and self-control to stay on that path.</p><p>While the suit of Pentacles typically focuses on material wealth and gain, the Nine of Pentacles also suggests that you are in harmony with the nature that is around you. You have an appreciation for the beauty and abundance found in nature, and you are able to harness this energy to bring pleasure into your life. You may enjoy gardening or floristry, or you may simply like to pass your time in the beauty of nature with picnics or walks in the park.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed Nine of Pentacles is all about self-worth. When you see this card in a Tarot reading, you may find yourself reflecting on your own sense of self-worth and value.</p><p>On the one hand, you may question whether you are really 'enough' – whether your skills are valued, whether you can charge higher prices or ask for a pay raise, or whether you can attract the right people into your life. You may be under-charging for your services, working for free or accepting a lower salary than you should. Know that you are worthy and deserve to be wealthy in all facets of the word.</p><p>On the other hand, you may be focused on increasing your sense of self-worth. Invest in yourself – get a wardrobe makeover, learn a new skill to increase your career 'value' or take a personal development course focused on self-love. Even if you are reluctant to spend money on yourself, know that it is okay to splurge on yourself and indulge in life’s luxuries, particularly if it makes you feel good and ‘worth it’.</p><p>Remember, you ARE enough. You are more than enough. You are AMAZING!</p><p>Sometimes, the reversed Nine of Pentacles can appear when you are so busy working and hustling that you have no time or energy to enjoy the fruits of your labour. For example, in an effort to build wealth, you may be working 70-hour weeks with no time for breaks, missing out on the opportunity to actually enjoy the wealth you’re creating. Know where the limit is with wealth creation – at some point you need to enjoy what you’ve created, rather than always being in hustle mode. Remember what is truly important to you. This may be a good time to retreat to a natural setting (a forest, beach, mountain or lake) to restore your energies and rejuvenate yourself.</p><p>Similarly, the reversed Nine of Pentacles suggests that you may need to release some of your focus on having to sustain a particular income and a particular standard of living, especially if this is coming in the way of other life priorities such as family or relationships. You may think you need the best of everything but, really, all you need is your family and loved ones around you. Do not be afraid to take a cut to your income for a short time or to reduce your hours at work, even if this means that you have to eat rice and beans each night for a week to make up for it! It is important that you are focused on what is most important to you. Finances may need to come second, and while you need to at least have food on the table, there may be some areas where you can cut back and reduce your dependence on material wealth.</p>"

    "id": "tenofpentacles",
    "img": "images/tenofpentacles.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Ten of Pentacles is a positive sign that you have accumulated wealth and abundance through your hard work and dedication and you can now enjoy and share this wealth with others. You have successfully navigated the challenges and obstacles along your path, and now you have reached a point of completion and accomplishment in your journey. As a Pentacles card, this sense of accomplishment is likely to be as a result of a successful career path, smart financial investments, a stable home environment and a possible committed and long-term relationship. This is one of those cards that shows that everything will eventually come together in a wonderful way and you will feel highly successful and proud of everything you have achieved.</p><p>When the Ten of Pentacles appears in a Tarot reading, you are surrounded by wealth and are blessed with financial abundance. There is no ‘wanting’ any more – you have everything you need, especially within the material realm. You feel financially secure and trust that, as a result of your personal successes and accomplishments, you will always have what you need and desire. You express deep gratitude for fulfilling your material goals and dreams.</p><p>This card reflects permanence and creating a lasting foundation for future success. It is a card of commitment to a sustainable future, taking into consideration not just the short-term benefits of a particular venture but also the long-term benefits. It is about investing in the long term and knowing that you need a consistent approach to achieve success that will last the test of time.</p><p>The Ten of Pentacles indicates that you feel compelled to share your success with others to ensure that they are well cared for. It brings you deep joy and satisfaction to see your loved ones benefiting from your wealth and abundance. You have worked hard to get here, and now you can see the bigger impact your accomplishments have on others. You are the ‘provider’ or the breadwinner, bringing financial security and stability to your family, ensuring they have everything they need to live a happy and comfortable life.</p><p>The Ten of Pentacles is also a sign that family is very important to you. Being surrounded by the people you love and who share your DNA and ancestry brings you great joy and happiness. You know you can trust your family whole-heartedly and they will be there for you, no matter what. You have invested in your family relationships and now this investment is paying off and you have their love and their loyalty. Your home life is good and you can provide your family with the security they need. You are also strongly connected to your family history and heritage, feeling a part of the long lineage that goes before you. It represents tradition, being a part of something bigger and realising that the blood of your ancestors runs through your veins.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>Upright the Ten of Pentacles is about wealth accumulation, an established family and home life, and attainment in the material realm. Reversed, you may be questioning whether this is really the way you want to live. Do you really want to be chasing the next $1,000 so that you can have the latest Jimmy Choo shoes? Do you really want to be pushing for marriage or a family instead of simply enjoying what you have right now? Do you really have to be stuck in the same job for decades simply to feel secure? When you see the reversed Ten of Pentacles in a Tarot reading, be prepared to question your need for stability, security and commitment in your life. It may sound good on paper or might be what is expected of you – but is it really what YOU want?</p><p>The reversed Ten of Pentacles comes as a reminder that sometimes, wealth can be a trap. When you surround yourself with expensive things and live a luxurious lifestyle, you may start want more and more and more, never feeling fully satisfied that you have enough. For example, you splurge and fly business class, only to realise you will never be able to fly economy again. Or you buy a bigger house that feels like a resort, only to realise you now have to pay for additional maintenance and cleaning to keep it in its pristine state. You may find that you quickly burn through your financial reserves as you desperately try to maintain this higher standard of living, and are unwilling to ‘downgrade’ even if your cashflow diminishes. Your feelings of self-worth may be inadvertently wrapped up in your wealth; if so, it’s time to unravel that connection and see that you can still live a happy and fulfilling life, even without the Jimmy Choo shoes and resort-style home.</p><p>The Ten of Pentacles reversed may indicate that you are experiencing challenges or setbacks when it comes to financial or job security and family stability. Your investments may have lost significant value, your marriage may be on the rocks, or your job may be at risk. It is time to re-evaluate your position and choose a course of action that will help you to regain your sense of security and self-worth.</p>"

    "img": "images/pageofpentacles.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Page of Pentacles, like the Pages of all four Tarot suits, brings a welcome message of new beginnings, inspiration and the initial stages of a creative project or venture. Since Pentacles rule the material realm and correspond to the element of earth, the Page of Pentacles symbolises a growing awareness of the value of money, wealth, possessions, career, and physical health, and how to manifest more of these material blessings. You are welcoming new opportunities related to your material life – a new job, a new business, or a financial windfall – and discovering how to turn your dreams into reality.</p><p>When the Page of Pentacles appears in a Tarot reading, you are focused on your ability to manifest a personal goal or dream, and may be in the midst of a new project such as a hobby, business venture, or the beginning of a new educational experience. You are excited about the possibilities and potential of what you put your mind to, knowing that with focused intention and action, you can create whatever you want.</p><p>That said, this Page does not indicate the fulfillment of dreams as much as the initial motivation and energy to begin the process of creating those dreams in reality. You need to put in place clear plans and actions that will ultimately lead you to achieve your dreams and goals. Stay focused on the practical and tangible elements, keeping your feet firmly planted on the ground and not getting carried away with more ideas and concepts but rather being focused on what is realistic and achievable. This is when your common sense and pragmatic approach will lead you to success and to finding a solution that works.</p><p>In the quest to materialize his dreams, the Page of Pentacles is an avid student and seeks to learn the skills that will ensure his success in the long-term. The Page of Pentacles often appears in a Tarot reading when you are ready to up-level your skills and learn something new, so that you can manifest your dreams. See this card as an invitation to take a class, continue your education or state an apprenticeship. Even if you are already successful in your current field, the Page of Pentacles encourages you to try something new and discover a new aspect of yourself in the process. The more skills you bring to your portfolio, the more goals and dreams you can achieve.</p><p>The Page of Pentacles may indicate that you are considering a new business or entrepreneurial venture. You are in the initial stages of setting up the business to be financially successful and abundant in the long-term. You might be new to this, but there is also great enthusiasm, commitment, dedication and a strong sense of responsibility to see the project through.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Page of Pentacles reversed indicates that you are exploring a new project or business idea, but you are not ready to move forward with it just yet. You may still be brainstorming ideas and you would prefer to keep it a secret right now. Or, you may be worried that you do not have the necessary skills or resources for it to be successful so you are putting it on hold or procrastinating. If the opportunity continues to present itself to you and you want to move forward but fear persists, trust that you have what you need now and the rest will develop as you progress.</p><p>The reversed Page of Pentacles can suggest that you are trying to get a specific project or idea off the ground but each time you try, it seems to amount to nothing, or it takes you even further away from where you want to be. It may be that you have not planned sufficiently, you’ve lost sight of your original inspiration, or that you are trying too hard. Give yourself some space and step away from the project for a short period so that you can re-energise and re-focus before trying again.</p><p>You may also be too busy daydreaming about new dreams and goals, without having taken any action on your original dreams and goals. So, you need to review your goals and think again about why you were originally motivated to achieve them. Think about what it will be like once you achieve that goal, and become re-committed to your objectives and the actions required to make your dreams a reality.</p><p>Finally, the Page of Pentacles reversed invites you to learn from your past mistakes. Even if a situation has not worked out the way you expected it to, you can discover new aspects of yourself that can then be applied to your present and future self to ensure success. If you are struggling right now, look to your past history and see where you may have gone wrong. Ask yourself, “What can I learn from these experiences? And how can I avoid making the same mistakes again?” Be open-minded and curious, and trust that your failures are what lead to your successes.</p>"

It is essential to you that you complete all assigned tasks and projects to a certain standard and that you follow through on your promises.</p><p>Sometimes, the Knight of Pentacles points to the more mundane or boring aspects of life – the daily grind, repetitive schedules, household chores, and other responsibilities and obligations. You may be assigned a project or given a task to do, and you will have to commit your time to see that project through to the end successfully. With the Knight of Pentacles, you will be required to accept responsibility without any complaints or grudges.</p><p>The Knight of Pentacles suggests that you are taking a very moderated and conservative approach to life right now, and while you may be feeling that change is imminent, you are sticking to your tried and tested ways of doing things. You have established that you need routine and careful planning if you are to achieve your goals. It may not necessarily be a very interesting or exciting period, but at least you know you are on the right path to achieving your goals. Even if you are growing tired and want to quit, this Knight invites you to keep at it and you will eventually see success.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Knight of Pentacles reversed suggests that you need greater self-discipline and commitment to achieve your goals. Instead of trying new things or dreaming up more ideas, the reversed Knight of Pentacles encourages you to establish a schedule or routine for yourself and stick to it until you have completed your assigned task.</p><p>The reversed Knight of Pentacles may also point to a journey of self-development or improvement, where a routine will support your success. For example, you may create a healthy eating plan or exercise schedule for yourself to help you become more fit and healthy.</p><p>You may also need to pay more attention to the practical matters in your life that you have chosen to ignore recently. Mundane activities such as home upkeep, money matters, business relationships and moving forward in your career have been left by the wayside as you focus on more exciting or important opportunities. Depending on what is on your plate currently, you may want to make more time to get your life in order, or you may continue to focus on more pressing or important priorities.</p><p>On the flipside, the Knight of Pentacles reversed indicates that you are feeling stuck in the daily grind and life has become boring and dull. While you may have originally implemented a routine and schedule to increase your productivity and efficiency, you are now finding that it is stifling your creativity and innovation. It may be time to do something different. Be spontaneous. You don't have to stick to the rules all of the time.</p><p>You may have also become unadventurous, overly conservative and resistant to change. You may prefer just to stay at home while others are out having fun and taking risks. However, you may be isolating yourself from others or losing the interest of your friends. Try to get out a bit more and be open to new experiences.</p><p>The reversed Knight of Pentacles can also indicate that you are becoming a perfectionist in how you approach your work. You may be critical of others who do not share the same attention to detail as you, and you may become quickly frustrated when their work is not at the same standard as yours. While your hard work is appreciated, you do not want to lose the support of others along the way and may need to be more flexible in your approach.</p>"

    "img": "images/queenofpentacles.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Queen of Pentacles is the nurturing mother of the material world. At home, she shows her love for others by cooking nutritious meals, maintaining a clean and inviting home, and giving warm cuddles to those who need it most. She is also able to work a full-time job and make a financial contribution to the household, often as the primary breadwinner. She is masterful at taking care of the practical needs of work, home and family, while also giving her love and support to those she cares about.</p><p>When the Queen of Pentacles appears in a Tarot reading, you are embodying the ultimate working parent archetype. You care for your family and domestic responsibilities while also making a living for yourself and creating financial abundance. You are able to maintain a healthy balance between home and work by integrating the two and finding your place of ‘flow’ and alignment. And you strive to create a warm and secure environment for your family and loved ones while giving your love and support freely.</p><p>Similarly, the Queen of Pentacles suggests that it is important to you that you are able to live independently, with a stable income and with enough time and space to also nurture your family and loved ones. You may be trying to create a better balance between your home and work lives, giving it your all in both domains and trying not to compensate one for the other. At the same time, you are also able to find time to invest in yourself and ensure that you have enough ‘me’ time in between all of your other commitments.</p><p>The Queen of Pentacles represents prosperity and security. You have worked hard to generate a level of financial or physical security which in turn gives you the ability to be generous with others and to share your wealth and abundance with those you love. You have used your financial prosperity to build a comfortable home environment and you are focused on investing in your family as well as your personal wealth.</p><p>This Queen asks you to maintain a compassionate, nurturing, practical and down-to-earth attitude when it comes to dealing with others and your present circumstances. You need to focus on creating a calm and balanced life for yourself. You need to be resourceful and practical, dealing with issues as they arise and coming up with realistic and simple solutions that fix the problem with minimal fuss.</p><p>At times, the Queen of Pentacles may represent a mother figure in your life who can provide you with loving support and nurturing to help you get through the influences of your past. She may be a teacher, a counsellor, a mentor or someone who you are very close to. Alternatively, she may represent a part of yourself, particularly if you are investing a lot of yourself into nurturing and caring for others and creating an established and comfortable lifestyle.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>When the Queen of Pentacles is upright, you are focused on nurturing and providing for others; when reversed, you are focused on nurturing and providing for yourself. You are creating financial independence, perhaps working for yourself, starting your own business or supporting your lifestyle with your income. You may still be in a partnership or family, however you are keen to ensure that you can sustain your own lifestyle, now and in the future, by yourself. You may have a separate savings account or a long-term investment plan to ensure that you can take care of yourself if need be.</p><p>The Queen of Pentacles reversed also suggests that you are nurturing yourself on a personal level. You may be preparing nutritious meals for yourself, going on retreat alone, and generally paying more attention to yourself and your needs. You are tending to yourself, knowing that in order to care for others, you need to first care for yourself. Trust that work and family can survive without you for a short period of time while you focus on you.</p><p>At times, the reversed Queen of Pentacles can indicate that your work and home life are out of balance and you are putting too much of your attention in one area to the detriment of the other. On the one hand, you may be very consumed in your work, working long hours, travelling for business or focusing on work even when at home. On the other hand, your home and family life may be taking over and you are unable to give your attention to your work. This might work on a temporary basis, but the ultimate goal is to integrate work and home life so that they are mostly in balance and harmony. You may also find a release by returning to a favourite nature spot (a forest, beach or mountain) and allowing yourself to take in this fresh, natural energy.</p><p>Similarly, the Queen of Pentacles reversed can point to inner conflict when it comes to balancing work and personal priorities. Despite trying to make it work, you may consistently feel that you’re not giving either work or home life enough of your attention. Sometimes, you just cannot do everything, and you will need to make some choices about where your priorities truly lie. You may also need to make new agreements with your partner or your boss so that you do not feel over-committed to one area. Seeking out additional home help, such as a cleaner, nanny or house-keeper, may also help you feel more at ease.</p>"

    "img": "images/kingofpentacles.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The King of Pentacles represents material wealth, financial abundance, and worldly success. This King is a true provider; he uses his ambition and confidence to create wealth for himself and others, and generates his self-worth from what he has accumulated and can share with others. He is also a fatherly figure who provides others with advice, guidance and wisdom, especially when it comes to financial and work-related matters.</p><p>When the King of Pentacles appears in a Tarot reading, you are confident and successful at attracting and managing wealth. Not only do you identify opportunities for growth and success, you draw upon your self-discipline and control to manage your wealth and invest it wisely for the long-term.</p><p>The King of Pentacles indicates that you are able to translate your vision into something that is tangible, practical, and often very lucrative. You are the ultimate business owner. You do not simply come up with ideas and hope for the best – you work hard to map out your plan of attack, gather your resources and manifest your goals, often with huge success. You are like King Midas – everything you touch turns to gold. When you apply yourself to your vision, you create huge success, particularly on a financial level. Money flows easily and abundantly to you; you have reached the pinnacle of your financial power and influence and can rest assured of your continued prosperity. You no longer struggle to achieve what you desire, like the Page and the Knight, and instead can accomplish anything you set your mind to because you have already proven yourself.</p><p>The King of Pentacles often indicates the final fulfilment of a creative task, business venture or investment. Through diligence, responsibility and attention to detail, you have achieved great things and can finally say that you have completed your task or attained your goal. You can now enjoy all that you have accomplished and the successes you have created. You have created a richness of life, not just financially but also spiritually, which will set you up very well for the future.</p><p>The King of Pentacles indicates that a methodical, planned and well-thought-out approach will lead you to success. You have experimented in the past with what works best and have landed on your own methods and practises that you know will continue to work for you in the future. Continue down this path rather than trying new ways of doing things. You know that you have reached the height of achievement and you do not need to take any more risks.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The King of Pentacles reversed asks you to look at your relationship with money and wealth. On the one hand, you may not be managing your wealth very well. You may be able to attract large sums of money through your business enterprises or a high-flying career, but as soon as the cash hits your bank account, it’s on its way out again as you splurge on expensive items or invest in high-risk opportunities. You are not treating your money with respect, and instead need to draw upon your self-discipline and control so that you can save for your future while still enjoying the fruits of your labour.</p><p>On the other hand, you may be putting money before anything else, negatively impacting your relationships and well-being. You may be a workaholic, over-investing in wealth creation and neglecting your loved ones. You may do anything for an extra buck, even if it means selling your soul and your integrity. You may be so impressed by other people’s status and social position that you kowtow to anyone ‘above’ you while dismissing anyone ‘below’ you. You might constantly name-dropping and trying to prove yourself by bragging about the people you know. If this resonates, step back for a moment and look at the greater impact of your obsession with money. Is it serving you in this state, or do you need to change?</p><p>At times, the reversed King of Pentacles represents someone who is very stubborn and rigid in his approach. When this King shows up in a reading, look at your life. Are you feeling ‘stuck in a rut’? Has life become so predictable and routine that it is completely dull and lifeless? Being grounded is a good thing, but every now and then, give yourself permission to break free and do something different. You don’t have to be so serious all of the time.</p>"

    "img": "images/aceofwands.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Ace of Wands is a sign to just ‘go for it’. This highly action-oriented card sees you feeling incredibly inspired and enthusiastic about pursuing a new idea or project that you have in mind. You are all revved up and raring to go. Use your creative energy and passion to take the first steps and get this project underway. Even if you like to have everything planned out before you begin down a certain path, the Ace of Wands is encouraging you to listen to your instincts and follow your gut. If it feels like a good idea, it probably is. So, start with a few basic actions to get things underway, and then continue to grow and develop your ideas through more complex actions later on. The important thing is that you act now, rather than spending more time planning or researching.</p><p>The Ace of Wands is also indicative of a time in your life where you have a ‘breakthrough moment’ and feel very inspired and motivated about a particular idea or passion. Your eyes have been opened to a whole new world and you are now very excited about the possibilities and the opportunities that are available to you.</p><p>You are showing huge potential at this time and are driven by a strong, creative force. It is as if there is a latent talent within that is just bursting to get out and be fully utilised. This is also a perfect time to draw upon your imagination and to make your dreams reality.</p><p>Something to keep in mind with the Ace of Wands, and any Ace for that matter, is that it is but a seed that is yet to grow into something more solid or sustainable. You are being offered an opportunity here that shows great promise but it will be up to you to make the most of it and to maximise the potential for the longer-term. It is almost like the spark that is needed to fuel a huge fire but you must work hard to build the fire up as the spark itself is not enough to make such a large fire.</p><p>The energy of the Ace of Wands can also signify a restlessness or uncertainty as to how to proceed. You may have energy and passion but not yet have a clear outlet for its expression. All of these wonderful ideas are beginning to build up from within and you are just bursting with energy but now you must find a way to effectively express this energy in a way that will set you up in the longer-term.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed Ace of Wands suggests that you are finding it difficult to clearly define what it is that you want. This lack of direction may be sapping your energy levels and leaving you feeling incredibly unmotivated and uninspired. As a result, you are often asking yourself if this is what you really want in life and whether there would be something better elsewhere. However, when you think about what other opportunities might appeal, you may struggle to really know what you want. To remedy this, you need to first focus on where your true passions lie. There is no point working towards a goal if you are not motivated or excited about reaching that goal. So, take some time to contemplate what it is you really aspire to and what you want to achieve out of this situation.</p><p>The Ace of Wands reversed can also indicate that you are weighed down by existing responsibilities and commitments and therefore cannot pursue the new ideas that you have. You need to revisit the Ten of Wands and release yourself of some of those burdensome responsibilities so that you can free up your time to pursue your newfound passions. Alternatively, you may take a break from your usual routine in order to allow your new ideas to flourish and grow.</p><p>The reversed Ace of Wands can indicate frustrating delays are getting in the way of you being able to progress with your projects and ideas. You are likely to feel very impatient at this time, particularly if you are highly action-oriented and you have just started to gain momentum in your activities. You might also be in a position where you have an amazing idea but you have not yet found the right outlet for that idea. Again, you are beginning to become increasingly impatient that you have not been able to manifest that idea just yet but perhaps that is for the best. Timing is essential, so be patient and wait for the best opportunity.</p>"

    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Two of Wands takes the spark of inspiration from the Ace of Wands and matures it into an actual path forward. Thus, the Two of Wands is all about planning and progressing. You have been able to take your idea and turn it into a feasible plan that you know will lead to your success. It is no longer just an idea but you now have a plan in place to ensure that your idea is carried out as you had intended.</p><p>The Two of Wands is also about discovery, particularly as you step outside of your comfort zone and explore new worlds and new experiences. It may take some courage to take the first step but this card gives you the confidence of self-knowledge. You know what your goal is, what your creative process is directing for you, and you are confident in its eventual fulfilment.</p><p>The Two of Wands indicates that you will begin to consider your longer-term goals and aspirations and will plan ahead for what you need to do to achieve these goals. You have already come so far but now you feel it is ready for a change, this time with your long-term future in mind. You may be considering overseas travel, further education or a major career change at this point in order to expand your learning and development, and to grow your horizons beyond your immediate environment. With careful planning, and a moderated approach, you will set yourself up for success in the future.</p><p>The Twos in Tarot often represent decisions of some sort. In the case of the Two of Wands, you are making a decision between sticking with what you know, or expanding your horizons and taking a risk. You know that the world has to offer you something ‘bigger’ or more meaningful, yet you are also aware that in order to maximise on this opportunity, you must leave your familiar grounds. Even though you have already invested a lot into your current circumstances, for you to be able to grow and to maximise your potential, it is imperative that you step out into a new world and explore your options.</p><p>This card shows the patience and focus of your intent. You have got the ball rolling and have started out on your journey, so now it is time to patiently wait for your rewards and watch as your ideas begin to materialise.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Two of Wands reversed suggests that you need to start organising your long-term goals and prioritising what is important to you and what you really want to achieve. At the moment, it may seem that you want so many things but you have not thought these through enough to make them a reality. Start at the beginning again and meditate on what is important to you and what motivates and drives you. Look at where your passions are, and then start planning how you will achieve these goals.</p><p>You may also be afraid to step out into unknown territories, despite the huge growth potential, instead preferring to stay with what is familiar to you. The trouble is your growth is current being stunted in your present environment and your world has become too small for you. It is time to bring your attention back to your original goal and understand the beneficial impact of taking a risk and stepping out into the bigger world around you.</p><p>The reversed Two of Wands can also indicate that you have overlooked some important details related to your plan for the future. You may have been moving full steam ahead but have recently hit a roadblock due to lack of planning. You may also be over-confident about your success, overlooking the things that matter most. Or, you may be losing your passion associated with your goal and are becoming easily bored and demotivated. It is essential that you re-ignite that passion, or start again with something you feel more inspired about.</p>"

    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Three of Wands indicates that your plans are now well underway and you are starting to consider even more opportunities to expand your current plans and maximise on the potential of your future. Everything is progressing steadily and as expected, thanks to your solid planning and ongoing motivation to persist.</p><p>The Three of Wands indicates opportunities to expand your horizons, through study, travel, business enterprise and learning. You need to become more aware of the opportunities that exist for you right now as there may be more than you are aware of. To best see and take advantage of them you must concentrate, cooperate and remain open-minded. You may be more aware that your best opportunities lie outside of your current environment, so it is time to think BIG. Consider what you can do to open doors for yourself and create more development and self-exploration opportunities. It also signifies the changes and challenges that are up ahead and that are associated with expanding your horizons and entering new territories. Given the man in this card can see far ahead of himself, then you are likely to already be aware of the upcoming changes and challenges and can prepare for them ahead of time.</p><p>Similarly, this card is also about embracing change and adopting a longer-term view. It indicates you are in a position of strength as you control what happens around you. Thus, this is a card of vision and foresight and looking for greater possibilities. You are being encouraged to become a visionary and to dream beyond your current limitations. Now is the time to accept your vision and be confident that you will achieve it. Move fearlessly into new areas.</p><p>Given the expanse of the water in the card, the Three of Wands often depicts travel. This card encourages you to think big in terms of where you want to travel to and what you will discover along the way. This card sees you travelling over water to a far-away country, where you will then have the opportunity to fully develop yourself and learn many new things. I see this as a wonderful card of opportunity that encourages you to be bold and take this leap of faith to truly develop who you are.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Three of Wands reversed suggests that you have attempted to embark on your own journey of personal development but you have been unable to accomplish the goals that you had hoped for. There may have been some unexpected delays and creative blockages to your path. There is disappointment and frustration, and a general feeling that you may have just wasted your time by even starting on this journey. What you may not realise, however, is that these setbacks are in fact an important part of your bigger life journey and will have contributed to your personal development anyway.</p><p>You may also be struggling to put your plans into action and you are now feeling worried that you have gotten in over your head and tasks appear overwhelming. You may have had a lack of foresight and were unable to detect the challenges as they arose, or you may have been unrealistic about the risks associated with your plans. Break down your plans into smaller tasks to make them more manageable and more realistic. Conduct a risk assessment ahead of time to understand what challenges you may potentially face, and then create mitigation plans to avoid or minimise those risks.</p><p>In a business reading, the Three of Wands reversed may indicate a lack of cooperation, wasted efforts, delays, or bad luck or obstacles from outside in commercial ventures. You may be dealing with a business partner or another business that is only out for their own material gain, and as such, you are at risk of being betrayed in your business pursuits. You may also find that there are shipping delays or product manufacturing delays, particularly if you rely on an overseas source as part of your business. You know that you need to be open to receiving help but you are also concerned about others exploiting you for their own gain.</p><p>In a relationship reading, the reversed Three of Wands can indicate that there is a fundamental issue of not being able to pursue your longer-term goals together. Your partner may want to travel or to expand their horizons by moving interstate or internationally but you may be reluctant to do so, putting an obstacle in your partner’s course. This is becoming a major issue for the relationship. For the relationship to work in the long-term, you need to work this out together and come to a compromise.<p/><p>Similarly, in the context of relationships, the reversed Three of Wands can act as an indicator that you are better off not engaging in any long distance relationships. Perhaps this is something you have tried in the past and you now realise that this is something that really does not work for you. You are wary of all the drawbacks and negative consequences associated with such a relationship, and instead you feel you would be suited to someone who was actually physically available and located nearby. You also know that you do not want someone who travels a lot, particularly for work, because again it means that they are not fully accessible or available to you.</p>"

In numerology, four symbolises stability and firm foundations, and in the case of the Four of Wands, you are now enjoying a period of happiness and stability. This card indicates a sense of harmony and balance as well as completion, and thus symbolises a time of peace and joy in life that come as the result of often difficult and challenging effort. The Four of Wands is one of the most positive cards in the Tarot deck and indicates general good fortune, satisfaction, and fulfilment.</p><p>With the Four of Wands, it is the perfect time to get together with your family and friends and to celebrate all the wonderful times that you have had together. Often, this card reflects the holiday period where you get together with the extended family and join in a celebration. Alternatively, it may be as simple as inviting your closest friends over for an intimate dinner and a few glasses of nice wine. The Four of Wands often points to a marriage, engagement, birth of a child, a birthday, graduation or other type of celebration that marks a special milestone.</p><p>If you have been working on a project, you will reach an important milestone and will have cause to celebrate. You have completed a significant phase of the project and can feel very proud of what you have accomplished so far. This card augurs a time of joy and satisfaction in life and represents the personal gratification of a job well done, a goal attained, and a vision beginning to be realised.</p><p>Given the Four of Wands is closely associated with the home environment, you may be working on improving or renovating your home. You may have recently purchased a new home or are very close to finding a new home and getting ready to settle down in your new environment.</p><p>The Four of Wands indicates peace, harmony and tranquillity. You may find a refuge from the turmoils of life, perhaps by meeting someone new in a romantic setting, or by finding a new place to live that is ‘away from it all’. If you have been experiencing any disagreements with others, now will be the time to make a peace offering and instead focus on creating harmony in the relationship.</p><p>The Four of Wands provides encouragement when things seem too daunting. The card serves as a reminder that most things in life do not come easily, and so when you do accomplish a major milestone, you should be proud of everything that you have achieved. The Four of Wands is also representative of move from one stage to another, and moving past mistakes and challenges to a place of peace, acceptance and happiness.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Four of Wands reversed suggests there is a lack of harmony or a breakdown in communication in your family or home. There may be tension between family members or loved ones and you are finding yourself getting caught up in other people’s concerns and relationship problems. This may leave you feeling uncertain about your own relationships and what you can and cannot depend on. You may also be going through a period of transition in your family and home life and feeling some tension as a result.</p><p>Similarly, you may find your home situation becomes increasingly unstable. There may be an external threat to the peace and happiness you once had in your home. You may be placed into a temporary situation which appeases your immediate concerns but does not yet solve the longer-term issues. Depending on your living arrangements, it may be better to move home for the time being to allow things to settle.</p><p>Given the upright Four of Wands reflects stability, the reversal of this card can indicate that you are going through a period of transition where there is little stability and security. You may be experiencing multiple changes in your life, such as changing jobs, moving house and/or leaving a relationship. While you know that this is an important transition that you need to make, it can be quite unsettling, leaving you feeling out of balance and uncertain about your future.</p><p>In a relationship reading, the Four of Wands reversed reflects someone who may not be looking for a particularly long-term relationship but is willing to invest in it for the time being. There is a lack of commitment, or even a fear of commitment, which is preventing them from wanting a long-term relationship.<p/>"

    "name": "Five of Wands",
    "id": "fiveofwands",
    "img": "images/fiveofwands.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>In the Tarot, the Fives typically represent conflict and change, and this is no different for the Five of Wands. This card indicates that you are in the midst of conflict, tension and competition and it is impacting your ability to move forward with your goals. Rather than being able to work together with others, you are coming up against it and are constantly being challenged on your point of view. The trouble is that everyone is trying to express their point of view and opinions but no-one is listening, and so there is little progress. There is only conflict, and there is little or no value in the discussions that are occurring. Similarly, this card is representative of a group of people who are committed to an end but they cannot fully agree on how to implement this goal, as each has their individual agenda as to how to bring this to fruition. Aim to turn this into constructive conflict by allowing each person to openly share their thoughts but then listen to other people’s thoughts. Once everyone has been heard and all opinions have been considered, determine the best path forward.</p><p>Sometimes, this type of conflict and discussion can be very positive, such as in the case of group brainstorming and problem-solving. You need a positive environment where you can test your ideas and have them challenged, and improved, by others. You may benefit by establishing a working group, committee, or ‘mastermind’ group with other individuals who bring varying perspectives and experiences. Be open to this type of conflict and discussion as a positive contribution to improving the quality of your ideas and actions.</p><p>The Five of Wands often points to competition where you are up against a number of people of similar quality or experience as you. You may not be used to having to compete with others just yet, as you have built your success on your own but now it is time to truly experience what competition really means and requires. It is like the top student who excels at university, only to enter the workforce with a number of other high-performing individuals and is forced to compete for the top spot. Where there is competition, respect your opponent but stand up for your point of view. Fight the tendency towards frustration, anger, hate and prejudice.</p><p>The Five of Wands also encourages diversity and differences of opinion. You may be in a situation where you are dealing with people from different cultures and backgrounds, and may be struggling with accepting their way of living. Know that each person has something unique to bring to the table and that you will actually benefit by learning more about them and what they have to offer.</p><p>The Five of Wands encourages an enthusiastic approach to change. Change is coming, whether you like it or not, however your challenge will be in ensuring that everyone is on the same page and is focused on dealing with this change constructively and positively. Currently, there is scattered energy resulting from misdirected enthusiasm. Everyone has many ideas but no-one is there to bring them into one consistent path forward. Your role may be in identifying a clear strategy and purpose that can be implemented by all involved.</p><p>Sometimes, the Five of Wands indicates a personal struggle and conflict, either about external or internal issues that are causing a lot of tension and confusion for you. You have different opinions of your own about how you should approach your current circumstances and you have not really worked out in your own mind what your final stance is going to be. You may be trying to work through your personal point of view on a number of external contentious issues such as abortion, immigration, globalisation, or the environment, or you may be working through personal issues such as whether you stay or leave a particular relationship or job. At the same time, you have others around you who have strong views about what you should do and this, in total, is creating a huge amount of conflict, tension and disagreement. Just when you think you have a clear point of view, you are challenged on that view or you discover new information, and you change your standpoint again. This process is actually highly beneficial and will help you to come to a well-researched and well-thought out perspective. Know, too, that there is no ‘right’ answer, and whichever path you do choose, someone is not going to agree with it. So, you have to find the most comfortable option possible that sits best with you. It may not be 100% right for you but you need to choose whatever is closest.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Five of Wands reversed can suggest that you have tendency to avoid conflict wherever possible. You may find that any sort of tension or conflict makes you feel quite uneasy and you wish it would just go away. So, you deflect a lot of that energy and just ignore the problem, if there is one. The trouble, however, is that in doing this, you may just be pushing some of your own concerns to the side, without really dealing with them or being assertive about them. Some conflict can be good, particularly if it is constructive and teases out the underlying issues in a way that then generates a better solution. Consider whether always avoiding conflict is the best way to go, or if you are finding yourself just compromising on what is important to you.</p><p>The Five of Wands reversed is like a sigh of relief after conflict and struggle. You are no longer up against so much competition and can just ‘be’. On more personal level, you have worked through your anger and hostility and you feel more secure in your relationships. You do not have to constantly prove yourself anymore.</p><p>The reversed Five of Wands can also indicate a realisation that you do indeed need focus to achieve your goals. You have come through a period of scattered thought and random ideas only to find yourself in the same place you were when you started. You now acknowledge that if you are to progress your goals further, you must focus your attention on your key priorities and stay committed to your goal without considering even more possibilities or opportunities.</p>"

    "name": "Six of Wands",
    "id": "sixofwands",
    "img": "images/sixofwands.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Six of Wands is all about success, victory and public recognition. Not only have you succeeded in achieving your goals, you are now being publicly acknowledged for your efforts and your results. You may have recently received an award, public acclaim or acknowledgement from your peers for the work that you have done. It may even be just a pat on the back or getting praise or recognition for your work. This instils a high level of confidence within yourself and gives you the strength to continue your efforts.</p><p>This card indicates that you have harnessed your strengths and talents in order to bring about a successful outcome in your endeavours. You have managed to get through the confusion of the Five of Wands, minimising your distractions, focusing on the task at hand. You have overcome the challenges along the way, and now you are focusing your energies on the one goal that will lead to your success. This is your time to shine and to come out on top.</p><p>The Six of Wands is such positive encouragement to believe in who you are and your accomplishments so far. Have faith in what you have personally achieved and how this will be received by others. Do not let fear or guilt stand in the way of your success. You ought to feel proud of what you have achieved and not afraid to hold your head up high and feel worthy of others’ attention.</p><p>The Six of Wands focused on creating success and building your personal brand and reputation. You want to be successful at what you do but at the same time, you want to ensure that others know about it and give you the recognition you deserve. You may need to promote yourself more frequently by sharing your success stories with others and encouraging them to follow a similar journey. If you do not already, you will soon have some great success stories to share within your personal networks. You may even be interested in applying for awards or scholarships in order to build your brand and receive public recognition.</p><p>The downside to the Six of Wands is that it can also bring self-importance, arrogance and egotistical behaviours. With victory you may come to think that nobody can be better than you and you end up with an inflated ego and a big head. If you take on this attitude, someone is likely to want to take you down and criticise you, bringing disappointment and potential disrepute later on. If empowered by the energy of the Six of Wands, keep in mind how you would feel if someone made you feel inferior or put you down. Reign in your ego and make your victory all the sweeter.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>With the Six of Wands reversed, you may find yourself doubting your abilities and your potential for success. You may feel negatively about yourself and as if you have failed both yourself and others. You are lacking confidence, and need the support and recognition of others to pick you up and give you strength again.</p><p>The reversed Six of Wands may suggest that you have had a fall from grace and have not received the public recognition you were seeking. You have either received no feedback for your efforts, or negative feedback. You may have expected things would have worked well but instead you are being punished in some way or you are being neglected for your efforts thus far. Now, your confidence has taken a hit, as has your professional reputation or at least your perception of your reputation. If a particular project has not been as successful as you had hoped, you may be better off moving to a new environment so that you can rebuild your personal reputation and brand, rather than trying to fix something that has already broken.</p><p>The Six of Wands reversed suggests that you may be trying to achieve too many things at once and may not be doing a good job at juggling all of these commitments. It may be best to focus on only a few things and do them well. This will help you feel more inspired and motivated about the activities you do commit to.</p><p>This Six of Wands reversed can reflect the transitory nature of success. One moment, you are on top of the world because you have achieved great things but then the expectation has been set that you will continue to perform to this level and when you do not, then you are suddenly knocked down and criticised. While victory and triumph feel great at the time, recognise that it is only temporary and you will have to continue sustaining a high level of performance to be acknowledged.</p>"

    "id": "sevenofwands",
    "img": "images/sevenofwands.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>Similar to the Five of Wands, the Seven of Wands indicates a struggle after initial satisfaction and fulfilment. This time, however, the struggle is about maintaining your position at the top while others compete and fight to achieve the same success and status that you have already achieved. Thus, competition is rife and you must continually prove yourself with the Seven of Wands. If your vision and creative effort is fulfilled to the point where there is public acclaim or acceptance of your success then you must expect competition and challenge, as other people will no doubt also desire the same things as you.</p><p>The Seven of Wands can also indicate a challenge to the continued success of a venture or creative project from an external source. While it appears to block your path forward, you can overcome this challenge or obstacle by drawing upon your strong self-confidence, self-belief and continual self-improvement. It can also be overcome with effort and clarity of purpose.</p><p>The Seven of Wands is about holding your ground, despite ongoing challenges to your position and authority. You need to take a stand and defend your position at all costs. This will take courage and persistence but you have the strength and determination to do it. You see yourself as a battler and no matter what the challenge, you still have it in you to stand up for yourself and fight to the end. So, although you are experiencing a number of setbacks at the moment, you need to continue fighting for what you believe in and confronting others who may oppose or threaten you.</p><p>There needs to be acceptance with this card that you are not always going to be able to win everyone over. There will always be challengers and opposition to your point of view and you cannot keep everyone happy all of the time. Thus, now is the time to draw your line in the sand, and say, “This is who I am and this is what I need right now.” There cannot be any compromise or negotiation at this time, just hold your ground with determination and courage.</p><p>From quite a literal perspective, this card can indicate that you will be required to give a speech or write a paper on a contentious or highly debated issue. You will need to be ready to defend your argument and present hard facts that support your point of view. Expect to be challenged but enjoy this challenge as it will help you to create an even more robust argument.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The reversed Seven of Wands reflects that you are feeling overwhelmed by the challenges and responsibilities in your life, finding yourself quickly snowed under and unable to look at the bigger picture. You may have taken on too many commitments and are now looking for an opportunity to focus your attention on only one or two things and do those things well. You may also feel as though you are having to compete against or are constantly comparing yourself to others, leaving you feeling somewhat inadequate and vulnerable. There is a need to return to the Six of Wands, which is all about building your own self-esteem and confidence, and having faith that you can achieve what you set out to.</p><p>The Seven of Wands reversed can also indicate that you feel as though you are constantly being judged or criticised by others. Your family or friends are questioning you on why you are doing certain things, such as staying in a challenging relationship or an unfulfilling job. You would prefer if they could just keep their mouths shut and let you be!</p><p>This card can suggest that you are trying to avoid conflict wherever possible, and as a result, you are backing down on your point of view too easily. As soon as someone challenges you or opposes you, instead of standing up for yourself, you compromise or give in. It appears that being accepted and liked by others is more important than standing your ground and fighting for what you believe in. Alternatively, you may have tried everything possible and have given it your best shot but you are now starting to realise it is not worth the struggle. Even though you may not have made any progress yet wanted to, it is time to let this one go and move on. It may feel like giving up but in the long run, it will be for the best.</p><p>On the other hand, the reversed Seven of Wands can indicate that you are taking things too far and you are being overly aggressive about protecting your turf. This is to the detriment of your personal relationships.</p><p>Finally, the Seven of Wands reversed can suggest that you are at risk of being caught unprepared. You are feeling shaken and vulnerable at the threat of a challenge to your position. You have the feelings of falling behind, and not being up to the challenge. Perhaps you want to cave in and give up the fight. This card shows a lack of confidence, courage, and conviction. You are feeling threatened, and have become easily manipulated and taken advantage of.</p>"

    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Eight of Wands indicates that the struggles of the Seven of Wands have now all but cleared and you have the freedom and space to move forward with your plans and activities once again. The Eight of Wands contains a high level of energy and movement that propels you forward to reach your goals at a much faster pace than ever before. You can expect to be very busy but this is one of those ‘good busy’ periods where you are enthusiastic and energetic about the progress you are making.</p><p>The Eight of Wands represents a very focused kind of motion and activity. The Eights are all about structure while the Wands are about raw energy. Thus, the structure of the Eight creates a channel through which the raw energy can flow. You are so sure about your goal that all distractions have been removed and you can devote yourself to the task with complete concentration, determination, and will. This experience can be very productive, allowing you to accomplish a lot in short time.</p><p>With the Eight of Wands, you can look forward to the rapid completion of a project that is currently underway but you can also expect to be occupied by something new and even more exciting and inspiring very soon. There really is no stopping you right now as you are just bursting with energy and ideas, and cannot wait to achieve one task in order to start another. To maximise this energy, it is important to ensure that your activities are focused on your broader goals and that you are investing in the right things at the right time. Also, make sure that before you move to the next task, your previous task is complete.</p><p>This card is a sign to ‘strike while the iron is hot’. It is most definitely an action-oriented card that encourages you to move quickly to pursue the best opportunities available right now. There is no waiting around while the Eight of Wands is present so determine where your energy will be directed and get on with it!</p><p>Often, the Eight of Wands suggests air travel. It is more likely to be a short-term or whirlwind trip, such as a business trip or holiday. You may even enjoy being part of a tour group that visits ten countries in as many days!</p><p>On the downside, the Eight of Wands denotes haste and rapid advancement of a situation which may result in the wrong decisions being made. It will be important to have all your resources available to be used in your best interests. Be mindful not to rush into things without having a clear plan of where you are heading.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Eight of Wands reversed can indicate significant delays, particularly with regard to travel or fast-moving plans. Despite having a lot of energy and enthusiasm to progress things forward, you are now being faced with multiple obstacles in your course. This is incredibly frustrating and you may be growing increasingly impatient by the day. Keep looking for alternative ways around the obstacles presented so that you can carry out your plans.</p><p>On the flipside, the reversed Eight of Wands suggests that you are charging ahead with an idea or plan but you need to slow down and consider your next steps before continuing. You may be missing something in your haste and prone to making mistakes. Similarly, this card can be a sign to hold off your activities for a short amount of time until the situation becomes more stable and predictable.</p><p>You may also be prone to having many, many ideas at the one time and not knowing which to pursue and when. Just as you get started on implementing one idea, another one comes to mind and you quickly switch your focus. The trouble is that with this approach, you never actually accomplish anything because you are jumping from one idea to the next without finishing any of them.</p>"

    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Nine of Wands suggests that you are so close to completing a particular project or task but at the last minute, you are faced with yet another challenge or setback. Know that you have the inner resources necessary to overcome any difficulty you encounter, even though it may seem impossible at the time. You are so close to finally achieving success, do not give up now! The Nine of Wands is a sign of hope and encouragement that if you stand firm and strong against your challenges, you will achieve your goal. The challenges before you now are only the last bit of darkness before the break of a wonderful dawn.</p><p>The Nine of Wands is like the one last test or challenge before you can reach ultimate success. You feel as if you have come to the end of your fighting powers but you have the skill and determination in reserve. You are in a position of strength and by drawing upon all of your courage and abilities, you will prevail. Once the last obstacle is overcome, you are home free.</p><p>The Nine of Wands encourages you to be resilient. You will continue to be opposed by hidden enemies and your interests will be questioned. Even in the face of such adversity, when you are feeling battled and bruised, you need to be patient and vigilant. Be assured that you will eventually prosper if you maintain your position. And remember, if you do not succeed at first, then try again.</p><p>You may have experienced setbacks that now leave you feeling distrustful of others or even yourself. The turning point will come when you are able to leave the past behind you and to cultivate a more open mind about the future. While you have experienced losses in the past, it does not mean that you have to experience further losses in the future. Turn a new leaf and push on.</p><p>Sometimes, the Nine of Wands encourages a risk-averse approach. You need to expect the worst and therefore take extra precautions to avoid any negative consequences to your plans. You need to be on guard and wary of any potential obstacles or opponents who may stand in your way.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Nine of Wands reversed suggests that you may be hesitant to make a long-term commitment. You may be feeling as if life is all work and no play, and you may feel overcome by responsibilities or a lack of support from those around you. You may also be lacking the necessary resources, such as finances, skills or time, in order to deal with the challenges head on. As such, you are hesitant to make any commitments in fear that your responsibilities will become all too much.</p><p>You may also be more inclined to be a little ‘on edge’ and on the defensive. The boundaries you have set around yourself are now becoming your cage, locking you into your old habits and behaviours. Be careful of dwelling on past frustrations and grievances. Just try to let go.</p><p>The Nine of Wands reversed asks you to be mindful not to make assumptions or hasty judgements. Lighten up a little and return to the Eight of Wands where you take life as it comes in all its various forms. Go with the flow and release yourself of the pressures you are feeling. A holiday or a break might do you some good where you can re-energise and rejuvenate yourself.</p><p>Sometimes, the reversed Nine of Wands can indicate extreme paranoia or even schizophrenia. You may feel as though you are constantly under attack or are being watched. Oftentimes, this is indicative of a fear from within, rather than an actual external threat. Counselling or psychological help is advised.</p>"

    "name": "Ten of Wands",
    "id": "tenofwands",
    "img": "images/tenofwands.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Tens in Tarot represent the completion of a cycle, and thus with the Ten of Wands, you have reached the end of a cycle after a period of struggle. You are finally reaping your rewards after investing a lot of hard work and effort. You have fulfilled a creative venture, realised a dream or accomplished a major goal, and now must deal with the consequences of that fulfilment.</p><p>However, the Ten of Wands suggests that even with the achievement of your goal, there comes with it great responsibilities and commitments. While you have reached a point of completion, you are becoming starkly aware that you must now carry on with the responsibilities you have laid out for yourself, in order to ensure ongoing success. The trouble is, however, that these responsibilities may become too much to bear and you are struggling to let go. It is a bit like the business owner who creates a flourishing business but who is unprepared to delegate some of his/her responsibilities to the staff, and ends up working 70-80 hours a week. The inspiration and creativity that was associated with the initial goal or vision rapidly disappears, and everything becomes hard work all too quickly. Thus, it is incredibly important to let go of or delegate some of your responsibilities in order to free you up to still enjoy life.</p><p>The Ten of Wands serves as a reminder of how much we take on in our lives and all the extra burdens and responsibilities we weigh ourselves down with. We take on so much, trying to do all the things that need to be done. Thus, this card asks you to stop and examine your current lifestyle or work. Assess which activities or tasks are really urgent or really important, particularly in relation to your broader goals. You may need to employ various time management or prioritisation methods in order to determine where best to spend your time and which tasks you can drop. Your goal needs to be greater efficiency, whilst also freeing yourself up for rest and relaxation when you need it.</p><p>This card can also mean that you are being oppressed by outside sources. You are over-worked, over-tired and over-stimulated. You have more on your plate than you can possibly handle and you have taken on too much at this point in time. In an effort to get to the finish line, you have found yourself overwhelmed with the extra responsibility and activity. You need to stop working so hard. If you cannot stop, then conserve your energy and pace yourself. When you are over-committed everything becomes a strain.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>Upright, the Ten of Wands reflects that you have taken on a heavy burden. Reversed, the Ten of Wands indicates that you are unnecessarily holding on to this burden when you do not need to. If you are feeling weighed down by your present circumstances, look at different ways you can lighten the load. Can you delegate certain tasks and responsibilities? Are you worrying about matters that do not concern you or cannot be changed? Do not become a martyr and take on more than you can realistically handle.</p><p>If you are going through a challenging time, then the Ten of Wands reversed indicates that this time will soon pass and you will feel less of a burden weighing on your shoulders.</p><p>You may be actively identifying those activities that do not bring you any value in your life and you are starting to release yourself from these unnecessary responsibilities. You may even be going through a purging process, clearing out old clothes and selling old furniture, in order to de-clutter and simplify your life. You will benefit from better organisation and prioritisation at this time.</p><p>Sometimes, the reversed Ten of Wands indicates that you are avoiding responsibility and making it even more difficult for others who must take on your share. Thus, the saying, “You have made your bed, now lie in it,” is very appropriate for this card.</p>"

    "name": "Page of Wands",
    "id": "pageofwands",
    "img": "images/pageofwands.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The Page of Wands is similar to the Fool in that he is a free spirit who represents change and new beginnings. He has a true passion for life, despite his understanding of this world is not yet fully developed. He has not yet been weighed down by the burdens of the material world, coming and going as he pleases, and usually encouraging change wherever he goes. He is like the catalyst that inspires changes that might be impossible in any other situation.</p><p>The appearance of the Page of Wands indicates that you are experiencing a creative restlessness within you that is just waiting for some sort of expression, or, you may be on the verge of some sort of discovery or new phase of life. The Page of Wands represents the sudden creative spark that comes to you, suddenly and unexpectedly, and that starts you down the road of a new creative vision. Thus, he encourages you to express yourself and your individuality with light-hearted abandon. Listen to your unconscious mind and follow your creative urges, even if you are worried about being the lonely voice crying out in the wilderness. With persistence and a balanced perspective even the immature desires of the Page of Wands can be transformed into a beautiful creative vision that can change the world.</p><p>Similarly, the Page of Wands indicates that you need to be positive and spontaneous but not overly impulsive. Your enthusiasm impresses others but if you become impatient or quick to anger or lose interest, you will put others off-side and you will waste time in your creative projects.</p><p>With the Page of Wands, you are inclined to give anything and everything a go. If you are enthusiastic or passionate enough, you embrace the opportunity to start out on a new journey or project and see where it takes you. You do not necessarily have a solid plan in place, nor do you really know where you are headed but you do know that you are excited about the possibilities.</p><p>You are enjoying being busy and involved in various activities and projects. You like the freedom of being able to choose what you will work on today, and hopefully it is different from what you worked on the day before.</p><p>Oftentimes, the Page of Wands is a messenger, bringing you inspiring or unexpected news, new information or a welcome surprise. It may be the birth of a child, a new and inspiring idea that a friend has, or a new opportunity for you to be involved in to ‘change the world’ such as a community project. His news is nearly always positive and welcomed because it is often associated with change and creation.</p><p>The Page of Wands may also represent someone you know or who is about to enter your life. He is a trusted friend who is devoted to your interests and will do everything he can to help you. His intentions will be honourable and genuine. He is here in your life to spark change, to help you see the world from a new perspective and to guide you towards a new approach. While you may look to this Page as an immature or child-like presence, he actually has a lot to offer you if you open yourself up to the possibilities that he shares with you.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Page of Wands reversed suggests that you have tried a few new ventures or projects but these have not been particularly successful. You may have had a vision to start a new hobby or project, with the view that it would lead to bigger and better things but you soon realised that you had taken the wrong approach and it wasn’t leading to the growth and development you had expected. You may have started to realise that you had not really focused enough on what your goals and objectives were and that is why you were not reaching the outcomes you wanted. Luckily, you had not progressed too far along and were able to easily retreat from those projects with limited impact. Sometimes, too, these setbacks can be helpful in testing out new territories and exploring what will and will not work for you.</p><p>You may also find that your eagerness to start something new has been negatively impacted by complexities, obstacles and opposition, which has resulted in a lack of motivation and indecisiveness about your path forward. You may also be fearful of whether you can really get your project or idea up and running, or if you are just going to be weighed down by more responsibility and troubles.</p><p>The Page of Wands reversed can depict a person who is immature with a self-image problem. It could be someone who is mean-spirited and aggressive, or someone who is helpless and always a victim. This is someone who never has anything good to say, is always pessimistic, and always brings everyone down. This person undercuts your enthusiasm and your self-confidence. Often, this is a superficial, lazy and arrogant person, one who is unwilling to make an effort, and is uncooperative and impatient.</p>"

    "id": "knightofwands",
    "img": "images/knightofwands.jpg",
    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>Whereas the Page of Wands indicated the initial spark of a new idea, the Knight of Wands indicates the actual pursuit of that idea. There is significantly more action associated with this Knight and he has a true commitment and energy to make sure his ideas are put into action. His courage is incredibly strong and he has no fear of anything. He simply charges forth with his ideas and visions to make things happen. Thus, the Knight of Wands suggests that your confidence levels will rapidly increase and you will feel ready to take on the world with your vision. Tackle any challenges that stand in your way and always be ready to help others who lack your determination and exuberance but who desperately need it.</p><p>The Knight of Wands is an ‘act first, think later’ type of guy. He is impatient and impulsive, with a love for action. The downside to the Knight of Wands is that while he is bursting with energy and enthusiasm, he has a tendency to rush into things without much consideration for the consequences of his actions. He sets off on his journey in haste and often fails to have a clear plan of attack and this may negatively impact his chances of longer-term success. He is so focused on being the best and of fame and glory that he almost forgets to plan ahead and to keep sight of reality. The Knight of Wands can also come across as aggressive and overly ambitious. He is highly insistent even if others stand in his way, criticise him or challenge him.</p><p>When you encounter the Knight of Wands in a reading, it is important that you start your creative projects with great enthusiasm and energy but you also temper this with a well-rounded, realistic and balanced view along with a well-considered plan that takes into account any future consequences of your actions. You need to show ambition and move from where you are now to where you know you should be to increase your effectiveness in the world. There is nothing wrong with ambition if it is channelled in the right way. Be a pioneer and take calculated risks.</p><p>The Knight of Wands may indicate an event that enters your life quickly and unexpectedly. Coupled with the Eight of Wands, you can expect to see a lot of change and action occurring around you, and you will no doubt be swept up by the restless, ‘busy’ energy whether you like it or not! An important matter is likely to enter your life and demand your attention until it passes. Rather than resisting it, make the time to give it your full attention. Oftentimes, the Knight of Wands can indicate a hasty change of residence, job or other living arrangement. You need to be ready to react quickly and go with the flow as resistance is useless.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The Knight of Wands reversed indicates delays and frustration, getting nowhere, and feeling anger at obstacles and at being denied what you want to have. This card, in the reversed position, represents a loss of personal power or the negative use of power. It can indicate that you are trying to camouflage or compensate for your inability to control this situation. Accompanying emotions may involve a loss of self-esteem and pessimism.</p><p>This Knight, when reversed, is impulsive, restless, impatient and lacking in foresight. He is so keen to just pursue his own interests or hurry things along that he fails to really understand whether he will be successful or what the consequences of his actions will be. If this is you, you need to be very careful of not rushing into things without thinking it through first. Even if you are starting to get frustrated with a lack of action, you need to consider the consequences before doing something. If this is someone in your life, then it is best to steer clear of them for the time being. They need to make these mistakes in their life to learn and improve, and cannot necessarily be controlled or held back at this point.</p><p>The Knight of Wands reversed suggests that you are at risk of acting impulsively, doing or saying things that you may later regret. You want everything to be ‘fixed’ straight away and have everything working out just as it should but you do not seem to be allowing yourself the time to really think through what is best for you. Be careful, too, that you are not reacting instantly to everything that happens but that you give your circumstances some space and time before you take action. You may also find yourself feeling frustrated that there are certain factors impacting your situation that you feel you cannot control. Again, remind yourself that there WILL be things that you can control and change as you want to.</p>"

She is not afraid to demonstrate her power to others nor does she shy away from a challenge. She is therefore a strong leader who is focused on her desires, intending to get what she wants.

You know what you want and how to get it, and you are masterful at engaging with others to achieve your goals. You are talented at staying fiercely determined and focused on your own goals whilst being friendly and optimistic with those around you.</p><p>The Queen of Wands is highly energetic and leads a busy and active life. She radiates health and vitality and has an inner vibrancy that fills her with ongoing energy and inspiration. This Queen is a natural-born, intelligent leader who actively inspires others.

    "meaning": "<p><u>Upright Meanings</u></p><p>The King of Wands represents pure fire energy. Unlike the other Wands court cards, he is not so interesting in actual creation and creativity, or in dreaming up ideas and implementing them himself. Instead, he is more inclined to take an idea and change the world to match his vision. As such he is a natural-born leader of all kinds of people, and he is very visionary. Once he sets himself a goal, he sticks to it and ensures that he can make it happen with the support of those around him. People naturally gravitate towards this King as they know he will get things done and will do it very well. He is a master, too, at being able to get other people to do his work for him, and keep them on-side throughout the process.</p><p>The King of Wands looks forward to challenges because he enjoys the natural rush of adrenalin associated with solving a difficult problem and coming to a solution that will benefit not just one person but many people. In the process, he not only rids himself of his own fear but that of others, by reassuring them that they shall all succeed. He is not all talk, either, and when the going gets tough, he is prepared to do the hard yards to see something through to the end. The King of Wands has a deep and innate respect for other people, and his compassion extends far. He knows how to bring out the best in others and to empower them to deliver his visions and goals, which he knows will be of benefit to the greater population.</p><p>The King of Wands is an indication that you are someone who is very visionary and goal-oriented. You achieve a lot because you are very clear about your future direction and how you will get there. You do not waste your time on activities or relationships that you believe will lead no-where. You never just go with the flow, instead you prefer to embark on a strong and direct course of action.</p><p>The King of Wands reminds you to lead your life with intent, vision and a long-term view. Know that even though you are experiencing challenges now this is just a part of your journey to something much more positive. Eventually, you will see this time as just a little blip on the radar and it will have simply served to make you stronger. Stay focused on your long-term goals.</p><p>The appearance of the King of Wands also suggests that an opportunity is presenting itself to you, and you now have the power to accept the opportunity and take on the challenge. You are the determining factor in this situation, and circumstances will navigate in the direction you steer them. Indecision or doubt will not be appropriate responses when clarity and confidence are required. However, as you progress in this new role, it will begin to feel more comfortable.</p><p>The negative aspect of the King of Wands is that he can be arrogant and even aggressive in his pursuit of his goals. He may be conscious or unconscious of this. For example, most of the time he does not show enough restraint to know when assistance is not needed or wanted, and he can sometimes make things worse by doing what he thinks is the right thing. Furthermore, once successful, he may become easily carried away with his newfound status and grandeur. He shows determination and vision to accomplish his goals at any cost, and while he is often a respected leader, there can be instances where he is prepared to go above the heads of others in order to fulfil his own dreams and agendas, potentially putting others off-side. This King can also become easily distracted by bigger and better things and he can become so accustomed to attention that he can take other people for granted.</p><p><u>Reversed Meanings</u></p><p>The King of Wands reversed personality type can make rash, hasty, and impulsive decisions. This person can be dominating, pushy, and overbearing at times. This is rarely done with malice or an intention to make someone else submissive, it is just a strong tendency that sometimes takes control. The King of Wands type usually does not even realise when he or she crosses the line between being assertive and aggressive.</p><p>At worse, the reversed King of Wands typifies the most selfish, ruthless qualities of fire. He can denote a manipulative business contact who will use you as long as it serves his purpose. He may be a rival, competitor or unscrupulous opponent. In love, he represents a delightful flirtation that could wreak emotional havoc. He is only suitable for limited liaisons, holiday romances or brief, passionate encounters. His flames are bright and warm but soon die down.</p><p>As an aspect of yourself, the reversed King of Wands can suggest that you have set your expectations of yourself too high and may struggle to achieve those expectations. As such, you may end up feeling like a failure because you have not been able to achieve what you want in both areas of your life. Set more realistic goals for yourself and know that you cannot do everything nor please everyone. There may also be times when you become frustrated with the lack of progress in your endeavours, particularly if this is being influenced by your dependence on others. You may find that there are some people who are holding you back and preventing you from fully realising your dreams and goals. If this is the case, it is best to cut them loose as no amount of energy will change their perspective. You may also need to be a bit more lenient on others and accept that not everyone has as much energy and drive as you to achieve results. Accept what they have to offer and do not expect anything more.</p>"
