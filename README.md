# Practical Tarot Reading V2

This version of the Practical Tarot Reading app eliminates user interactions and tries to provide answers based on a random selection of cards. Be aware it might or not provide correct answers since it doesn't depend on the algorithm itself. We can't say if user interactions are an indispensable part of the process. One must try both versions and see what works better for them. To try out the standard version click here https://github.com/pierremacedo/practical-tarot-reading/

*78 cards deck.  
*Two spread modes available: 3 or 5 cards.  
*Includes reversals.  
*Includes instructions on how to make better questions in order to get better answers from the oracle.
